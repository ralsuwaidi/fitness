**27M 6’3”**

**Starting Weight: 205 lbs**

**Current Weight: 188 lbs**

Around 2.5 years ago my now wife and I went on a trip to Costa Rica with her family for the Christmas holiday break. When I got back and looked at pictures of myself it really hit me that I was no longer that guy who could eat whatever he wanted and not gain any weight. In my teens and early twenties I was pretty active, played sports, and never had to pay much attention to what I ate. Somewhere along the lines I stopped being as active and everything started catching up with me. I started hitting the gym that week and haven’t stopped since.

I initially dropped from 205 to 178 in about 6 months, so about a pound per week \(more in the beginning, less towards the end\). I did IIFYM and IF and tried to eat about 80&#37; clean and 20&#37; treats. I lifted in the past for sports, so I knew my way around weights enough to get by. I started out with some random routine I found online that was some sort of reverse pyramid training 3 days a week, but I honestly can’t remember exactly what it was. After my initial cut, I had kind of a fail on my first bulk and put on too much fat and not enough muscle. I cut down again and ended up around 181 with slightly higher body fat, so I didn’t really add much mass.

Finally did my first successful bulk/cut this past year starting last June. I just finished up cutting down for the summer from my bulked weight of 204 to 188 and am probably at the lowest body fat I’ve ever been. I’m guessing I’ll end up around 190\-192 when I start eating more again and upping my carb intake. For both the bulk and cut I did a PPL routine 6 days a week and dropped volume as needed during my cut. I stuck with IIFYM throughout and did IF when cutting. I also added some cardio towards the end of my cut, either walking up hill or jump rope.

Overall I’ve learned a lot these past couple years and have really enjoyed lifting and bodybuilding as a new hobby. Looking forward to starting my next bulk soon. Feel free to ask any questions, I’d be happy to provide more info for those that are interested.

**Diet:**

I use MFP to track everything that I eat.

I try to eat clean 80&#37; of the time and then treat myself 20&#37; of the time with sweets or really fatty foods.

I do about \~1 g/lb body weight for protein, \~0.4 g/lb body weight fat, and the rest carbs. I eat anywhere from 2000\-3400 calories depending on if I am bulking or cutting and my TDEE is somewhere around 2800.

I eat a lot of chicken, but am not a fan of just baked chicken, rice, and veggies. I try to mix it up and make different things but here are some go\-tos:

· Chicken Tacos

· Chicken Stir fry \(use riced cauliflower instead of rice when cutting\)

· Pizza on cauliflower crust \(Trader Joe’s has a good one but it’s on the higher end for carbs\)

· Pasta \(use spaghetti squash when cutting\)

· Chicken chili

· Some prepackaged pastas, Indian food, etc from Trader Joes

· Lunch meat wraps on lavash \(low cal for a large wrap with a lot of fiber\)

· Protein shakes

I like to try new things and my wife and I will often try different recipes and modify ingredients to make them “healthier”. It helps me keep on my diet to have some go to things where I know all the macros, but also try new things to keep from getting bored. However, I do eat pretty much the same turkey wrap for lunch every day. I’m typically too busy during the day to care what I eat and it fits in with my macros well most of the time.

When I’m bulking I also add in things like bagels and cereal for extra carbs. I also have a protein shake almost every day.

A sample cutting meal would be:

· 10 AM Post Workout: Protein Shake

· 12 PM lunch: Turkey wrap on lavash with chips \(the baked Jalapeno chips\) and sometimes another shake

· 7 PM dinner: Chicken tacos with Mexican rice and veggies for dinner

Bulking is similar, but I add:

· A bagel with cream cheese for breakfast.

· Milk and sometimes fruit or peanut butter added to protein shake.

· More carbs with dinner, so have more rice with tacos for instance.

· A bowl of cereal with 2&#37; milk before bed.

**Lifting:**

I honestly don’t remember much about my first routine when I initially lost weight and unfortunately I lost the spreadsheet I had on my phone. It was a reverse pyramid training program that was split up into a 3 day per week workout.

More recently I have been doing a PPL routine:

6 days per week starting with push on Monday. I typically rest on Sundays, but sometimes in the middle of the week if something comes up. I’ve subbed in different lifts at different times and like to play around with new lifts from time to time, but here is an example of what I would do on each day.

**Push:** incline or flat bench \(3x8\), shoulder press \(3x8\), chest flyes \(3x12\), lateral raises \(3x12\), tricep extensions \(3x12\), tricep pull downs or dips \(3x12\)

**Pull:** seated rows \(3x8\), weighted pull ups \(3x8\), single arm rows \(3x12\), face pulls \(3x12\), barbell curls \(3x8\), hammer curls \(3x12\)

**Legs:** squats or leg press \(3x8\), straight leg deadlifts \(3x8\), leg extensions \(3x12\), leg curls \(3x12\), calf raises \(3x12\), some sort of abs \(switched up frequently\)

I do different rep ranges from 4x6 to 3x12 and typically stick to higher weight lower reps for the compound exercises and vice versa for accessories, but I switch things up periodically to keep myself engaged.

Some numbers:

Incline bench: 215 3x8 \(haven’t done flat in a while honestly, but probably around 240 3x8\)

OHP: 160 3x8

Squat: 275 3x5

Pull\-ups: bw \+ 65 3x8

Seated rows: 215 3x8

I don’t deadlift anymore, but SLDL: 275 3x5

I tore my hamstring a while back so leg numbers didn’t progress as well as upper body since I had to stop training them for a while.

I also add in some cardio like walking on the treadmill at an incline or jumping rope when I’m near the end of my cut.

**Lessons Learned:**

**IF and IIFYM are great:** I think intermittent fasting is great for cutting. I’m not sold on all the extra benefits that some claim it gives, but it does allow me to eat a giant delicious dinner every night, which really helps keep me on my diet. I also really enjoy IIFYM since it allows me to work in foods I really enjoy on a regular basis. Make sure to get enough micronutrients though as that can be easy to overlook sometimes. Eat your vegetables and take a multivitamin.

**DON’T DIRTY BULK:** If you really want to, go for it, but I don’t think it’s worth it. I had a great few months on my first “bulk” just eating whatever I wanted and getting nice and fat. But I ended up putting on mostly fat and made barely any progress once I cut down. If you’re natural I just can’t see a reason to do this. Your body can only put on so much muscle at a time. I still like bulking/cutting rather than doing a very slow bulk year\-round because I think you get better results and I like switching it up, but you have to bulk within reason.

**Stick with a program:** While I do like to tweak things here and there, I think it’s important to stick to a base program for a decent period of time. Don’t waste your time trying to find the new best thing every other month. Just pick something and stick to it. Unless you’re a very advanced lifter most programs will work for you and you’ll be more inclined to continue going to the gym if you stick with one routine. Feel free to make some small modifications if you want to keep things interesting or fit your needs better, but don’t gut your whole program.

**Weekly Treat/Cheat meals are awesome:** Every week I have one meal where I don’t track the calories or macros at all, although I don’t go too crazy and eat an entire pizza and order of breadsticks by myself. Typically my wife and I will go out to dinner somewhere. This really helps keep me on my diet and makes me feel good from both a mental and physical standpoint.

**Have a workout buddy:** If you enjoy working out on your own that’s definitely fine, but I find it helpful to have someone to lift with. My wife and I do a great job of keeping each other on track and doing thing like pushing the other to go to the gym when feeling lazy. It’s nice to have someone else to help motivate you when you may not always have the motivation yourself.

**Track your changes:** Take tons of measurements and progress pics. It’s the only way to know for sure how you are progressing and it may seem tedious but you’ll be thankful for that info when you want to reflect back and see how far you’ve come. If you’re a nerd like me, put it all in excel and make lots of charts :\).

**Fit in cardio where you can**: When you’re cutting you can fit in random times to do cardio to help with the weight/fat loss. I used to walk to and from work which came out to around 3 miles of walking a day. I didn’t realize it but it definitely added up. Also, my wife and I live in the city so we take nightly walks around the neighborhood. It’s about a mile and half of walking and it’s a nice added bonus of getting to spend extra time together.
