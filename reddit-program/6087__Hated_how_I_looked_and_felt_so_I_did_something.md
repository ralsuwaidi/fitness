######First, photos and stats:

######TL;DR
Decided to get healthy, and in shape before I turned 30 years old, and did something about it. Lifted weights, counted my calories, and worked hard. No special diet program, just simple stuff that almost anyone can do.

##Summary
A little over 9 months ago I looked at myself in the mirror (literally, and figuratively), and I didn't like what I saw. I was a 29 year old, very overweight, lacking motivation, and confidence. My energy levels were low, and I knew it was effecting my family (wife and kids). I was tired of it, and wanted to finally do something about it.

###Phase 1: Lose Fat ASAP
######March 2015 – June 2015 (3 months)
* **Eat Healthier, smaller portions** – I knew I was super over weight, so I needed to lose fat. I used [LoseIt App](https://www.loseit.com/), and counted everything that went into my mouth. I calculated my TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure) using online calculators, and adjusted my calories about every 2 weeks.
* **Lift Weights** – I started lifting weights with a friend of mine who had already been lifting for a few years. He taught me the ropes, and helped introduce me to some starter routines. During Phase 1, I did a basic Push, Pull, Legs (PPL) routine. I split this between 4 days per week (M, T, R, F).
* **Light Cardio** – I did about 15 minutes of cardio 2-3 times per week after lifting weights, just for some cardiovascular health, and to help with the weight loss.
* **Macronutrients** – I aimed for about 200g Protein daily, and then didn't really count my carbs or fat.
* **Calories** – I ate anywhere between 1800-2000 calories a day.
* **Example Daily Meals** 
* Meal #1, 4 egg whites, 2 eggs, cereal
* Meal #2, 6oz. Chicken, sweet potato, veggies
* Meal #3, Preworkout: Protein Bar
* Meal #4, 8oz Protein, carbs, and veggies
* **Cheat Meal** – Every 7-10 days, I'd have a cheat meal. Note: NOT A CHEAT DAY. Just a meal. This meal I would eat whatever I wanted, as much as I wanted. Usually it'd be a couple greasy burgers, chinese, or a pizza. These meals gave me a little something to look forward too, and also helped push off my weekly cravings.
* **Favorite Meal**: [Qdoba](https://www.qdoba.com/). You can get a LOT of protein packed into very little calories, if you order right. I love Qdoba.
* **Ending Weight**: 198 lbs. 

###Phase 2: Gain Muscle
######June 2015 – October 2015 (3 months)
* **Eat a lot** – I like to eat, so this phase was much easier for me. I actually probably gained too much weight, too quickly, and I will be changing that in my future "bulk" phases.
* **Calories** – I aimed for about 3300-3500 calories per day.
* **Example Daily Meals** 
* Meal #1, Lots of eggs (8-10), protein shake, and cereal
* Meal #2, 8oz. Chicken, sweet potato, veggies
* Meal #3, 8oz. Beef w/ noodles
* Meal #4, Protein bar, PB&J Sandwich
* Meal #5, 8oz Protein, carbs, and veggies
* Meal #6, Before bed: Yogurt, or cottage cheese
* **Macronutrients** – My goal was about 220g-250g Protein per day, and filled the rest of my calories with carbs and fats.
* **Weight Training** – Because I had so much more energy, I added in another day in the gym. So I began going 5 days per week. I gained a lot of strength during this phase too, which I attributed to the amount of calories I was consuming, and better form/technique that I had been developing with the help of my friend.
* **Challenges** – People talk about dirty bulks vs. clean bulks. Dirty bulking is obviously easier, and much more enjoyable. You basically eat everything you see, without regard for anything. I probably fell somewhere in between dirty and clean. I think it's good to find a balance, because if you do it too dirty you'll end up gaining quite a bit of fat. Like I did.
* **Cardio** – None.
* **Favorite Meal**: Donuts for breakfast, and Burgers for lunch. Ya, not healthy at all, I didn't eat this every day. 
* **Ending weight**: 232 lbs 

###Phase 3: Cut the weight, reveal gains
######October 2015 – December 2015 (3 months)
* **Calories** – Basically went back to what I was eating in Phase 1. 1800-2000 calories per day. With a cheat meal every 7-10 days.
* **Trying to keep strength** – I really feel I have my routine, and form dialed in right now with my weight training. Currently I'm doing a split that is kind of a mixture of a PPL, and "Bro-split". I really like it, and I feel exhausted after every workout, which is good.
* **Cardio** – I try to do cardio once per week, but honestly I often skip it. I'm really trying to get more consistent, because I know that it's good for my cardiovascular health. But it just hasn't been top priority for me.
* **Current Weight**: 200 lbs.
* **Weight left to lose**: ~15 lbs.

##What Motivated me?
Honestly my biggest motivation came from wanting to prove myself wrong. All my life, I've just accepted that I was overweight, and that it was pointless to try and do anything about it. I ate food for comfort, and when I was stressed. Every time I went to buy clothes, I dreaded it, because I knew nothing would fit "just right". I hated looking at myself in pictures, and always secretly felt embarrassed.

I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it, and that **it doesn't have to be complicated**.

##So what's next?
1. Enjoy life more with my family, friends. Get out and do things that I could/wouldn't do previously. I just want to be the best I can for them.
2. Take my shirt off this summer, and feel confident!
3. Keep losing weight! I'm wanting to diet down to about 10% bodyfat, and then start another bulk phase. This time, doing it more clean!
4. After this time I've spent working on my diet and training, I've really gotten into bodybuilding, and I considering trying to compete in the future. I know I'm still a long ways away, and I'm pretty old to begin competing, but I don't care. I just want to give myself a new challenge.

##Biggest thing I learned?
1. **Failing is ok** – I had many days where I felt I had "failed". But I had to keep reminding myself why I was doing what I was doing. So the next day, I would just start over, with a clean plate, and get back on track. I had to remember that it was a "marathon", not a "sprint". Failing is ok, just get back up the next day, and move forward.
2. **It doesn't have to be complicated or expensive** – Honestly the biggest thing I learned is that getting in shape isn't rocket science. No matter what anyone tells you. All these instagram fitness coaches, supplement businesses, and "weight-loss magic" sellers, are just trying to make money. Some of their products might assist, but none of them are a replacement for hardwork in the gym, determination/commitment, and a balanced diet. I didn't follow any "special program". I just stopped stuffing my face with food all the time, and starting going to the gym a few times per week.

##Final thought.
Was it difficult? Yes, many days were struggles to go back to the "old me". Would I go back to how I was before? No way in hell.

#####Edit 2: A couple more tips
1. **Weigh yourself everyday!** A lot of people say not to do this, but I'm a firm believer in doing it. I believe it helps you get more familiar with your body, and how it works. You see, and understand the fluctuations in your weight throughout the week. If you only weigh yourself once a week, you could be weighing yourself when you're retaining a lot of water, or not retaining. And you could get discouraged if you are up a pound or 2 after a week of eating well. If you weigh yourself DAILY, then you see these fluctuations constantly. (e.g. of how my weight would fluctuate. I weighed almost every day for the last 9 months.)
2. **Take at least 2 photos a week**, to track your progress. I can't emphasize this enough! The scale isn't always the best way to track your progress, as you can see from my progress pics. I weighed almost the same in my before, and after phase 2 pics, but my body composition was much different. If I had only relied on a scale, I could have been discouraged by this. But I had plenty of pics to look back and see.
