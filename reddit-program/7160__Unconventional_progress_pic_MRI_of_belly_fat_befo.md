My friend's a grad student who works with MRI. He scanned himself before and after working out for a year. This is a slice through the belly at around the level of the belly button. The bright stuff is fat, the dark stuff is muscle / organs. 

Notice how you don't just lose subcutaneous fat (the flubber we can feel), but visceral fat (the fat IN your abdominal cavity around your organs). The muscles are all bigger too.
