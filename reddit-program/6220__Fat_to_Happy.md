Hi, 
Just wanted to post this and give a few details for those who are not feeling good about themselves and need a bit of a push. I know many read this forum in the hopes of getting a glimmer of insight into what to do to be happy about their bodies.

All sorts of methods work, this is mine. I'm 5'10 and 37 years old. 250lbs then, 200lbs now.

Diet : I ate less, instead of 5 slices of pizza and a large diet coke, I'd eat 2 slices of pizza and water. Everything in moderation, my fridge and freezer have everything in them, but I eat less of it. Ice Cream, beer, pizza, chicken, burgers, mcdonalds etc. Instead of one Mcdouble and a large diet coke, i'll eat 1 mcdouble with no drink or fries. If i feel like ice cream such as a mcflurry or dairy queen, instead of jumping in the car, i'll get my boots on and walk to the restaurant so i'm burning half the calories just getting there and back.

Total calories in the day is about 2200-2400

Exercise : This is what I do.

Sunday : Bench 5x5 + 2x15 and then throw in skull crushers or just tricep pull downs on the rope.

Tuesday : Deadlifts or just back exercises like seated rows or dumbbell rows + biceps(usually sloppy curls in the mirror)

Wednesday : Bench 5x15 and then shoulder press, either in the squat rack as a standing military press or I use a machine.

Saturday : Squats, I change it up a lot on this day, my favorite is the paused front squat, seems to burn the most.(I pause right at the bottom for 3 seconds) As for sets and reps, always changes.

Before every workout I walk on the treadmill for 30 minutes at 15% incline @ 3mph, that according to the treadmill burns 880 calories an hour. If i'm short on time, i'll run at 13mph for 20 seconds, rest for 40 seconds and rinse and repeat for 6 running sessions

I'm not old but i'm not young either, so my max lifts fluctuate with my weight and food in-take, I find injuries crop up as I get older. Max lifts are, bench is 325lbs, deadlift is 505lbs and squat 405lbs, depending on my in-take and weight. 

One of the biggest pros to all of this is my energy levels and confidence, this might seem very stupid, but your dick does look bigger when your lose weight, if that isn't motivation enough I don't know what is, unless your huge already :/

My waist dropped from 40 to 34, and even now I can get a thumb or two in the jeans so i'm more like a 33, so its easier to find clothes, another benefit.

Hope you all can find your own method and motivation.
edit, thanks for the gold! wow.
and the pic difference is 3 years,
