For the first eighteen months of this, I was kind of winging it at the gym and just trying to eat right to the best of my ability. I plateaued at ~175 lbs and couldn't seem to make much more progress. It was then that I began seriously reading these forums and discovered all types of things involving nutrition and fitness; most importantly, counting calories. I decided I wanted my abs to be visible. I learned that for this to be possible, a body fat of ~10% or less was required. So in June, I downloaded MyFitnessPal and began counting my calories. It was also then that I adopted a vegan "diet", at first for nutritional benefits, and now for all sorts of reasons. 
 
My average caloric intake over this period ranged from 1,500 to 2,300 per day; I was experimenting for the first three months or so. Now it seems as though 1,800 - 2,000 allows me to lose the amount of fat that I'm comfortable with. Here are my most current dietary goals:
 
----------
 
##**DIET**  

**CALORIES PER DAY:** 1,800*
 
* Protein: ~110g
* Carbs: ~300g
* Fat: ~70g

* *Calories per day was my goal with cardio included. I am realizing the macros don't add up.*
 
###**FREQUENT FOODS**
 
Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks weren't planned whatsoever. I would pretty much just eat throughout the day whenever I was hungry. The key was sticking to reasonably low calorie foods and keeping the cheat meals at a minimum:
 
* Cereal
* Bananas
* Baked beans
* Boca burgers
* Gardein products
* Tofurkey products
* NuGo protein bars
* White or brown rice
* Lightlife smart dogs
* Steam-in-bag vegetables
* Soy, almond, coconut, and flax milk
 
###**CHEATING:**
 
* Whiskey
* Craft beer
* Taco Bell (I know)
* Diet soda (not really a cheat, but kept my sanity)

###**SUPPLEMENTS:**
 
* Creatine
* Beta Alanine
* Various types of soy, rice, pea, and hemp protein powders

##**REFLECTIONS, LESSONS LEARNED, & ADVICE**
 
To be brief, there are two very specific things that influenced my change and neither of them involve fitness. If you care to know, they are the films of [Terrence Malick](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrence_Malick) and the music of [Tool](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tool_%28band%29), specifically "[Lateralus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lateralus)".
 
I mention those unrelated influences to highlight the fact that a desire for a "nice body" isn't necessarily a prerequisite to significant physical, mental, or emotional health. I wanted my *life* to improve. Those two things were my conduit, but I soon did realize that my health would eventually need to improve at least *somewhat* for me to be comfortable. Hell, my original goal weight was 185! When I reached that, I kept going. I felt a hunger and addiction because the results were tangible and I could feel myself changing in every single way, all for the better.
 
In reading these forums, the one thing I've taken away is this: *Do not believe everything you read here or anywhere else*. There are absolutely wonderful things here, especially in the FAQ, and certainly from various posts I've read over the last six months; but do not believe or adhere to any one thing. *Experiment* with your own body. Do not be discouraged if something is working wonderfully for someone but doesn't seem right for you. It's incredibly discouraging to strive so hard at something and fail miserably. I will tell you that I've tried countless different exercises and routines (both dietary and physical) and am just now starting to figure my body out. 
 
A long time ago I read someone say, "Anyone who has exercised for less than five years is a beginner.", and I called complete bullshit on that statement. Now, though, two years into this myself, I am starting to see his point. Your body is so complex that it's utterly mind-boggling. So many people want such a quick fix. It simply doesn't work that way. It takes effort. It takes time. It takes dedication. If you allow these three things to work in conjunction with one another, you *will* see and feel results.

##**MOVING FORWARD**
 
This week I have started a 'clean, slow' bulk. That is to say, I'm eating 250 cals above maintenance, upping my protein, and following P.H.U.L. (Power-Hypertrophy-Upper-Lower). My plan is to do this for three months, cut back down for three more, and see what I've managed to accomplish. I have never been more excited about any aspect of my life than I am for these next six months. Although it was not the original spark, fitness has absolutely changed my life. Thanks for reading.

##**FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS & COMMENTS:**

* **"Do you have trouble getting protein being a vegan?"**

*No.*

* **"Juice!"**

*No.*

* **"Your lifts look like shit and -insert broism here-"**

*My lifts were for maintenance purposes only and were set at very moderate weights accordingly. Most of my focus was on diet and cardio.*

* **"Did you drink alcohol?"**

*Yes, but put limits on myself. One craft beer per night, tops, with one or two small glasses of whiskey, tops. I plan on cutting it down to the weekends during this bulk.*

* **"Do you have loose skin?"**

*Yes, but pretty minimal. It is visible when I sit down.*

* **"How much could you run when you first started out?"**

*For the first month or so I was unable to even run for 10 straight minutes. Consistency is key. I can do a 10k without being remotely winded, now.*

* **"Should I do cardio before or after weights?"**

*In my experience, absolutely after weights. This does not apply to leg day, though. Don't do that.*
