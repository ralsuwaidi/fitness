I posted [my progress pictures](http://i.imgur.com/WoOdCx9.jpg) on /r/Brogress yesterday, I got so many nice comments that I thought to write about this journey in more detail here. 

### Initial motivation 
My starting weight was 62kg (137lbs) and height 185cm (6'1") at 20 years old, I didn't grow taller but I grew my physique and the way I live.

I always wanted to go to the gym, I browsed ~~4chan's /fit/~~ /r/fitness and /r/bodybuilding a lot but never really got around to it. There was a gym in my town but it was quite expensive â‚¬65 per month for 1 free weight area and a stupid [milon circle?](http://www.miloncirkel.com/)..

### Moving to England

Almost 2 years ago, I moved to the UK (Swindon) and they had a 24 hour gym. I thought, no more excuses and let's go. Browsing reddit and other forums I decided to start with Stronglifts 5x5. 

### Stronglifts 5x5

This was a great workout to start with, I did it for 3 months straight, never missing a single workout and gained a lot, the beginning is always fast. In those 3 months I went from 62kg (137lbs) to 70kg (155lbs). I got my bench up to 60kg, deadlift 120kg, row 70kg and OHP 45kg. I was **over the moon**, I felt stronger, shirts started to fit tighter and people started to notice slightly

*Diet*: My diet at that time consisted of.. eating a ton of food and whole milk (GOMAD). I didn't count calories (still don't) but I always checked what pasta had the most calories, what meat etc. That and the additional 2000kcal I got from drinking 2.5L whole milk a day had me gaining a lot of weight. I stopped doing GOMAD after my skin started to get bad (a lot of pimples) and I had to go to the toilet about every hour. 

### PHUL 

After feeling *fairly* strong and done with Stronglifts, I started [PHUL](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/phul-workout). 4 days a week. I did this for about 3 months and again, saw some nice gains. Switching up routines has worked really well for me. After ~3 months I just don't get sore anymore, so I change workouts and then I do. I did this workout up until like 76kg (167lbs).

*Diet:* During these 3 months, I again, ate as much as possible. I was completely done with the milk but started taking weight gainer shakes. I bought the [Optimum Nutrition](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/sm.html) one and took one before bed, every night.

### PHAT

After not getting sore anymore from PHUL, I started [PHAT](http://www.simplyshredded.com/mega-feature-layne-norton-training-series-full-powerhypertrophy-routine-updated-2011.html). 5 days a week, training hard. I did this for about 4 months and saw decent results. I got up to 80kg (176lbs), my goal weight. You know what happens once you reach your goal? You feel great, but you want more (or at least I do). So the current goal then was (and still is now) 90kg (200lbs).

*Diet:* Nothing special, still kept up the weight gainer shakes every night and just ate **a lot**. 

### Moving back to the Netherlands

My year in England was done, I wanted to move back. It was as if the god Brodin himself wanted me to keep getting gains because in my tiny town, there suddenly was a brand new, shiny **24h** gym. This couldn't be a coincidence.

### 6 day PPL split

I started with 3 days a week, went up to 4 days a week, moved to 5 days a week so now the most logical next step to me was to go 6 days a week. So I did with this [6 day PPL split](https://www.muscleandstrength.com/workouts/6-day-powerbuilding-split-meal-plan). I had been lifting for almost a year now and people told me I looked like I lift.. **Achievement Unlocked** -> Not looking DYEL anymore, finally. So I did this 6 days a week, again never skipping a workout and religiously going, looking forward to every day. 

**Diet:** Same old, just eat a lot. I moved back with my parents so I don't decide what's for dinner anymore... I got tired of the weight gainer shakes so I found something even better. "quark" with wallnuts.  I can't find the direct English word for it but it looks like [this](https://www.boodschappenboer.nl/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Almhof-Volle-Kwark-Spaanse-Sinaasappel-500g1.jpg), it's like really thick yoghurt. One 500ml cup with wallnuts contains about 1050kcal and again, I took one before bed, every night. 

### Lazar Angelov's workout + Running

I started this workout a month ago, when I was 83kg (182lbs) and I am at the time of writing, 85.5kg (189lbs). [This workout](http://www.gymaholic.co/articles/fitness/19/lazar-angelov-workout-and-diet) is a lot of fun and has muscle group days rather than pull / push days. Which is nice after ~10 months doing PPL. Before starting this workout I took a week off lifting because I had been lifting non stop. I hated not lifting and not going to the gym. Every hour I was thinking about the weights, looking at /r/bodybuilding, images of Steve Cook and Calum von Moger.. After that week I started the workout and man, I got super sore (again)! 

**Running**: So my new job was on the 4th floor, I take the elevator every day because Dom told me cardio kills gainz. I took the stairs "for fun" once and noticed my endurance sucked big time. Since Lazar's workout is 5 days a week, I got 2 rest days. That's 1 too much so I started running. Just 5-8km every Sunday. 

**Diet:** Same as with the PPL split, living the quark and wallnuts still.

### Supplements

I took protein shakes, BCAAs, ZMA, whatever. None of them longer than 2 weeks because I just didn't dig the shakes. The only supplements I have taken daily and will continue to do so are:

* Creatine (3g)
* Multivitamin
* Fish Oil

I feel like that's all I need, 5 pills when I wake up (multi + fish oil) and 1 scoop of creatine before I go to bed.

### Sleep

8 hours a night, every night. I know and feel sleep is important. My new job requires me to get up at 05:45. This is why I am in bed 21:45 Sunday to Thursday. I religiously sleep 8 hours at least and about 8.5-9 in the weekend. 

### No alcohol

This is an overstatement, I sure drank some pints in England with my colleagues but only 1 night a week. If I drank Friday, I didn't drink on Saturday and vice-versa. I barely drink **any** alcohol nowadays as it just doesn't taste as good anymore. I used to love drinking beer with my friends but now I just drink water, only water.

### Conclusion

Starting to lift has been the best decision in my life. I was always that skinny kid with red hair. I was scared of confrontation and I just felt weak. Now 1.5 years later people tell me I'm "getting big" and "starting to look like a closet" (that probably sounds cooler in Dutch). Someone in that /r/brogress thread told me I inspired him (or her). That was really cool to hear. I hope to inspire more people and that's why I wrote this long ass post. 

EDIT:
I don't know why my post got locked but I didn't do it. Thanks for the nice PMs everyone and yes I like this manbun for now, I'm not going to cut it off because a few internet strangers tell me to haha!

EDIT2: 
Some of you have asked my Instagram / Snapchat, it's the same as my reddit username but I don't post a lot. Just the occasional gym selfie..

EDIT3: 
So it went kinda viral, [The LAD Bible posted it on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LADbible/posts/2680121988701641?comment_id=948105178606573&notif_t=like). My Reddit friends tell me I look like a cool viking and Facebook people call me out on the hair (which I wear because I like it) and are super mean. <3 for you guys.
