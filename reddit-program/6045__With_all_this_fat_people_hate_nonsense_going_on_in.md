...I was refreshed to come here and see none of it.  Now whether that is the mods removing stuff being posted or just the community rising above it, it is nice to see.

Every sane person knows that hating people doesn't help them, encouragement and education does.  As a former fat person myself I suppose I have a different perspective to some other 'fit' people but let's all remember to help people improve (if that's what they are trying to do) and not ridicule them.  

And if you are a fat person reading this post who is wondering what the other people in the gym are thinking about you, it is not all this bollocks being posted on this site. I think I can speak on behalf of most of us in this sub when I say that upon seeing a fat person in the gym I think 'fucking good on ya mate' not 'errr you are scum'.

We all started somewhere.

Edit: Because this post seems to be getting quite popular and will likely be seen by a lot of people, some of whom will not be subscribed to this sub, I am going to post a [crudely mocked up progress picture of myself I just made in paint](http://i.imgur.com/kHAd14F.jpg) in the hope that it could inspire one or two people to make some positive changes in their life. If I can do it you can.
