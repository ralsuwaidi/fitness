M/35/6'0"

I started at 270 lbs, and currently weigh 225 lbs.

Diet:

Meal 1: Two whole eggs and two egg whites, protein shake with 25g of protein and 1 tbsp MCT oil

Meal 2: 1/2 lb 93% lean ground beef patty

Meal 3: 1/2 lb chicken breast

Meal 4: 1 cup rolled oats with 25g protein powder

Meal 5: 2 cups cooked white rice (short/medium grain for post workout, basmati for off days) and 1/2 lb chicken breast

Supplements:

Multivitamin, triple strength fish oil (3 a day), potassium, magnesium, berberine, Vitamin D, Probiotic, digestive enzymes, vitamin C, Calcium, L-Arginine. That's everything I take in a day. The L-Arginine I only take on days I lift, and I take it after I've had my dinner. I also take 3 tbsp of Psyllium Husk fiber mixed with 40 oz of water before I go to sleep every night.
