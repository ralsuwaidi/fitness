So I posted progress pictures last night and got a lot of positive feedback and people asking for details so I figured I’d make an attempt at a more in depth post on here. 

Before anything else I’ll throw a before/after picture on here so you can see if you feel it’s actually worth ready about the stuff I did. So the before picture is from my 27th birthday and the after was taken about 5 minutes ago in the hotel I’m staying in for work.

Ok so now that we’ve got the biggest contrast out of the way I’ll try and go through the whole journey.

**Stats**

-29

-6’2”

-Starting weight 236 lbs

-Current weight 176

-B/S/D at the very beginning: 135/NA (I lift at home and didn’t have a rack)/205

-B/S/D when I finished first cut: 225/275/385 (form was pretty rough)

-B/S/D at end of dreamer bulk: 260/335/435

-B/S/D now: 270/345/445

-B/S/D peaks: 280/355/460 (I actually made progress on second cut for quite awhile but the last couple weeks I started losing ground on lifts)

**What got me started**

I can’t say any singular event got me started on getting in better shape but I spent several years gaining weight and being in denial about it. There was a picture that kind of woke me up that I’ll link below but it was still almost 2 months after I saw that picture that I decided to actually take action. I was super skinny as a teen and healthy weight in my early 20s. Around 23 I changed jobs and became far less active which started my weight gain. I never liked having my picture taken so I don’t have many pictures of myself for most of this time frame but I found a couple from vacations when I was 25/26/27 and the steady gain is quite obvious now looking back. Rather than just saying all this I’ll link a gallery showing the progression from skinny teen, to normal weight 21 year old to progressively heavier guy in his mid 20s.

Ok, now that you’ve seen me get heavy I’ll show you my first cut, my subsequent dreamer bulk, and then the current cut.

Now that you’ve seen the various stages of my progress I will get into what I ate and how I lifted. That is if you’re still with me.

**Diet**

-Cutting calories first time around: ~2000

-Bulking calories: No clue, I ate whatever I wanted.

-Cutting calories second time: Did 2100 till I for into the low 180s, been doing about 1800 the last 6 weeks or so.

I did CICO (calories in, calories out) for both cuts and focused on getting ~180-200 grams of protein every day. As far as fat and carbs go I didn’t ever worry about them, just get protein and let the rest do whatever. I see so many people on here that followed a strict diet but I never did. I spent large portions of both cuts eating shitty food like burgers or pizza and then having to have nothing but a protein shake for dinner. The only thing I tried to be good with was avoiding alcohol but to be honest I’ve never been much of a drinker so that was easy. I’d say I had maybe 2 or 3 beers on special occasions over the 2 years but probably not more than 10 or 12 in total. To try and be of some help I will list the things I most frequently consume when shooting for my protein.

-CorePower 42 gram shakes. (I know it’s cheaper to mix your own but I’m lazy)

-Epic bars. (Chicken Sriracha and Venison)

-Tofu. (Not the best protein ratio but still pretty good) 

-Greek Yogurt. (Siggis 4% mixed berry is the best I’ve found)

-Chicken (I eat thighs because the flavor is worth the lessened protein ratio imo.)

-Protein Bars (Mission One, FitJoy, and ThinkThin are my favorites)

-Tuna steaks (More expensive but incredibly protein dense and delicious) 

Im sure there are things I’m forgetting but that’s a decent look at the stuff I eat or drink on a regular basis. Obviously I shoot for vegetables too as they’re important but again I’m not great about eating them regularly. I feel like if you’re lazy about food like I am, getting frozen broccoli and microwaving it is probably your best bet. As a final note I drink a lot of sparkling water when cutting as it helps me feel full for quite longer. Best I’ve found are Wegmans but since most people don’t have Wegmans I’d recommend Bubbly and Schweppes. I know everyone loves La Croix but it’s just not for me.

**Supplements**

-Creatine (mixed with my morning shake)

-Gummy multivitamins (I know they’re not that great but I like them)

-Pre Workout (Can’t really recommend any as I just buy whatever is on sale)

**Sleep** 

This is super important. I honestly am terrible about getting 8 hours (I average about 6 1/2) because I work a ton but anytime I buckle down and focus on getting more sleep I see noticeable improvement in the gym. Don’t be like me and only do that occasionally. Get 8 hours because it really does make a difference.

**Cardio** 

Over the winter basically none. In the spring, summer, and fall I try to run ~10 miles a week and play a couple hours of tennis. When I was cutting hardest back in late 2016 I had to stop running as it was killing my deadlift and squat numbers but that doesn’t seem to be an issue anymore. May have been mental or may have been eating too little while doing too much. If muscle is your only concern I would say there’s not much need for cardio but I try to be consistent with it since it’s good for the heart and I lift not only to look good but to feel good and be healthy so why not take care of my cardiovascular system too. 

**Lifting**

The one that probably most of you are interested in. This is like the food part, I see so many people on these progress posts on here that detail this strict workout program they followed to the letter. That was never really me. I started that way and made my best progress and it’s certainly the smart way. But the last 6 months have mostly been kind of a PPL where I do whatever I feel like doing that day as long as it pertains to the muscle group for that day. But again to try and make this post useful I’ll run through the programs I did and then give an example of a week in my current lifting routine.

At the very start I ran Stronglifts as I think a lot of people (especially on here) do and progressed quickly at first. Unfortunately my cutting calories didn’t mix with that very well once my noob gains ran out and I stalled pretty hard especially on upper body. 

From there I started doing 5/3/1 BBB (I know, I know that’s dumb to do on a cut but it seemed like a cool program) and I did actually see progress for several months running that. My lifts eventually stalled but I decided that I was going to stick it out and just try to maintain strength levels until I hit my 186 lb goal, with the mentality that once I started bulking I’d progress again. And that’s exactly what happened. I stagnated on all lifts for the last three months of the cut but only lost 10 lbs on my bench and 5 on my squat. However once I started bulking I reset all my one rep max figures -10% and began anew with great success. My bench went up 35 lbs, squat 65, and deadlift 50 (started focusing more on form which is why it went up less). I stayed with 5/3/1 BBB until I hit 205 and realized I’d let myself gain too much and had to cut. 

This is the point where I switched over to my current workout schedule. Surprisingly I made a decent amount of strength progress on this cut. As stated earlier it is basically PPL but without any set exercises for given days. Here is an example of what a week might look like.

**Sunday**
Flat bench 5x3
Bodyweight dips 5 sets of 30
Shoulder press 5x5
Lateral raises 5x12
Push ups 5xfailure

**Monday**
Deadlift 5x3
Bodyweight pull ups 6x12
Bent over rows 5x5
Face pulls 5x15
Curls 5x15

**Tuesday**
Squats 5x5
Weighed lunges 5xfailure
Front squat 5x12
Ab roller 5x20

**Wednesday** 
Rest

**Thursday**
Incline dumbbell bench 5x12
Weighted dips 60lbs added for 5x15
Lateral Raises 5x15
Tricep pulldown 5x15

**Friday**
Trap bar deadlift 5/3/1 rep scheme
Weighed chins 35 lbs added 5x12
T bar Rows 5x10
Dumbbell curls 3x15

**Saturday**
Squat 5x5
Front squat 5x12
Hanging leg raises 5x20
Stiff legged deadlift 5x12


And again that’s not what I do every week. That just an example and it’s pretty close. I may trade out dips with close grip bench or do extra sets of pull ups and skip curls or whatever but I think you get the idea.

**Summary**

I have a bad habit of rambling even in text form so if you’re still reading then you much be a patient individual. I wish I could be more exact with details but the reality is that as I’ve stated numerous times...I never was super strict with the small details. I always counted my calories while cutting, I always got my protein, I tried to get my sleep, and I made sure I was getting at least 5 days in the gym every week. But as far as the minutia of what I ate and what rep schemes I used....I was never disciplined enough for that. 
I hope this post can motivate some people, especially those who are worried that it’s essential to be extremely strict about everything to progress. I’m not saying my way is better, (it’s certainly less efficient) just that if you’re patient it can work. Thanks for reading and I’m happy to answer any questions you may have. I am headed to bed now but I’ll check in the morning and if this generates interest I’ll check in numerous times tomorrow and answer anything I’ve missed.

Edit: Added calories, height, starting weight, current weight, and training numbers. Also there are a lot of duplicate questions so if I don’t answer yours, look through the thread because if not I’ll have tried to answer the same question elsewhere.

Edit 2: I THINK I have fixed all my typos, fixed some formatting, and added details I missed. If anyone sees anything that still looks off let me know and I’ll fix it.
