[According to this article in Wired](http://www.wired.com/2015/10/who-does-bacon-cause-cancer-sort-of-but-not-really/), processed and cooked meat does increase risk of colon cancer, but far less than smoking cigarettes increases risk of lung cancer.

> The scientific evidence linking both processed meat and tobacco to certain types of cancer is strong. In that sense, both are carcinogens. But smoking increases your relative risk of lung cancer by 2,500 percent; eating two slices of bacon a day increases your relative risk for colorectal cancer by 18 percent. Given the frequency of colorectal cancer, that means your risk of getting colorectal cancer over your life goes from about 5 percent to 6 percent and, well, YBMMV. (Your bacon mileage may vary.) “If this is the level of risk you’re running your life on, then you don’t really have much to worry about,” says Alfred Neugut, an oncologist and cancer epidemiologist at Columbia.

The same tiny risk profile appears to be present for other red meats.

Anyway, the article is worth a read. And if you are a smoker, quitting is still the #1 thing you can do for your health.

EDIT: [Smoking also is correlated with colorectal cancers](http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/92/23/1888.full) and you can [lower your risk for colon cancer by exercising, losing weight, drinking less alcohol, eating more fiber in the form of whole grains and vegetables](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/news/features/six-ways-to-lower-your-risk-for-colon-cancer), and getting regular screening after the age of 50. A vegetarian diet was associated with a 22% lower risk for colon cancer in one study, but [a pescatarian diet was even lower at 43% reduced risk](http://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/vegetarian-diet-linked-to-lower-colon-cancer-risk-201503117785), probably due to the Vitamin D and Omega 3 fatty acids.

EDIT2: And just for even more perspective, [30-60 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical exercise daily may reduce colon cancer risk by 30-40% according to the National Cancer Institute.](http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/obesity/physical-activity-fact-sheet#q4)
