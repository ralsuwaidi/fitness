**What is a lacrosse ball? How does it work?**

* When someone gives you a deep tissue massage, they use their palms/fingers/elbows to apply pressure to help relax tight muscles and make you feel better. A lacrosse ball is a fairly hard, dense ball about the size of a tennis ball that helps mimic this deep release massage with your own bodyweight.

* The best part is that you could go to town on your **glutes and hamstrings** in a way that not even many massage-therapists will because of how intimate that area is. (When was the last time someone FIRMLY massaged your ASS? Right?)  So thats why I have one, to get free ass massages, haha. (No but seriously, it's great for the whole body.)

**Lacrosse Ball Video**

* **[Here is the video I made for it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUjoQuJ36OU&index=5&list=PLOj76wV2WfPuiHYrXTYsRQ67xfOJTcNd0)** But I know not everyone wants to watch a 6-minute video, although I tried to make it concise, so I made looping GIF's with my doggie to help save redditors precious time.

**Lacrosse Ball Alternatives**

If you don't have a lacrosse ball, you could use a tennis ball, baseball, softball, billiard ball, cricket ball, floor hockey ball, golf ball, spalding bouncey ball as alternatives. They don't work as well as the lacrosse one in some cases, but it's better than nothing and sometimes it may even be better!

**Foam roller?**

About a year ago I made a similar post showing [how I use a foam roller](https://redd.it/2kzaix) with a video+GIFs to tackle very large areas of the body. A foam roller in combination with a lacrosse ball, is my peanut butter and jelly.

**Edit:**

Epiccc # of upvotes. Thanks guys.  I knew when I made the gifs, it looked a bit crazy with me staring at the camera... but... I was like, whatever, it is what it is I guess. I enjoyed making them though. The way I go about making them is by clipping a tiny section of me going from one direction to the other, putting it into photoshop (file-import video frames to layers), then from the animation tool bar, find the arrow to select all layers, then paste layers after last frame, then reverse pasted layers (this is in animation toolbar), delete middle frame and last frame cause those are redundant, and then export as video, upload to gfycat, rinse repeat. Oh and I use gfycat cause they were the first service that supported html5. (Imgur copied them long after.)
