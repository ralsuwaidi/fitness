#**What is a foam roller? How does it work?**

* A foam roller is a large, cylindrical self massage tool. You roll over this cylinder and the pressure of your own bodyweight helps to knead your muscles and relax large areas of your body. So, that's why I have one. It's like getting free massages for the rest of your life.

## **Foam Rolling GIFs**

I also made looping GIF's with my doggie to help save you time.

* [Upper Back](http://gfycat.com/CooperativeImpracticalGrassspider) (avoid lower back; edit: [read here why](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5pwxki/foam_rollers_and_lacrosse_balls_are_awesome/dcukorl/))
* [Neck](http://gfycat.com/NastySomeCanadagoose) (not meant to be aggressive)
* [Calves](http://gfycat.com/RemorsefulHandsomeHarrier)
* [Shins](http://gfycat.com/OccasionalLameChafer) (lateral side to get anterior tibialis)
* [Quads / Hip Flexors](http://gfycat.com/CircularLastHatchetfish) (bent legs and/or straight legs)
* [IT Band / VLO / Hip](http://gfycat.com/AcidicCanineHornshark) 

**Note:** I like to do 10 passes for each body part. However, you don't *have to* constantly roll back and forth. Sometimes, just putting pressure on ONE tender spot and holding it for 30-60sec is effective, too.

## **What is a lacrosse ball? How does it work?**

* When someone gives you a deep tissue massage, they use their palms/fingers/elbows to apply pressure to help relax tight muscles and make you feel better. A lacrosse ball is a fairly hard, dense ball about the size of a tennis ball that helps mimic this deep release massage with your own bodyweight. It allows for much more localized pressure than a foam roller.

* The best part is that you could go to town on your **glutes and hamstrings** in a way that not even many massage-therapists will because of how intimate that area is. (When was the last time someone FIRMLY massaged your ASS? Right?)  So thats why I have one, to get free ass massages, haha. (No but seriously, it's great for the whole body.)

# **Lacrosse Ball GIFs**

Again, I made GIF's with my doggie to help save time.

1. [Gluteus Maximus](https://gfycat.com/MessyGrayCockatoo)

2. [Piriformis](https://gfycat.com/JadedIgnorantCollardlizard)

3. [Hamstrings](https://gfycat.com/DisloyalAnotherDutchshepherddog) (sit on hard surface and place under thigh)

4. [Feet / Plantar Fascia](https://gfycat.com/InstructiveAdvancedCicada) (hold onto something for balance)

5. [Upper Back (Traps)](https://gfycat.com/NaturalKlutzyHellbender)

6. [Triceps/Brachialis](https://gfycat.com/MerryForthrightBoubou)

7. [Triceps alternative style](https://gfycat.com/ImportantFloweryBobolink) (tack ball and straighten/bend elbow)

8. [Gluteus Medius](https://gfycat.com/AnnualSneakyHarpseal) (Static, just chill over it)

9. Deltoids & Upper Chest against wall (no GIF of this, it's in the video tho and it's worth mentioning that you could do it)

Note: Instead of constantly just rolling over the parts in question, you could also statically hold against them and just breath and relax for 30-60seconds. This works extremely well for the glutes and triceps and many other areas.

**Lacrosse Ball Alternatives**

* If you don't have a lacrosse ball, you could use a tennis ball, baseball, softball, billiard ball, cricket ball, floor hockey ball, golf ball, spalding bouncey ball as alternatives. They don't work as well as the lacrosse one in some cases, but it's better than nothing and sometimes it may even be better!

With the combination of a lacrosse ball and foam roller, I can practically massage most of my body and the best part is, **these don't take up much room and I could easily travel with them,** *especially* the lacrosse ball. Happy rolling!
