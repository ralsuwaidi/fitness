Hi everybody, Antranik here. I created these two videos recently to improve upon the [r/bodyweightfitness Recommended Routine ("RR")](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) and I'm sharing them here as well. The link is in the header and the summary is below them.

### 1. [Video: How to do Proper Pullups](https://youtu.be/P9knQsSe23o)

* There are two phases of a pullup: The scapular pull in the beginning (with straight arms) and then the actual pullup.  This can be done in one fluid motion but if you take a video of yourself and find your shoulders remain shrugged up *or* if you can barely get the chin-over, you should consciously focus on improving your scapular pull.

* Also, make sure you're **going down ALL THE WAY** and NOT doing half-ROM pullups which are *super* common. Another tip is to keep your feet uncrossed, thighs together and in front of you as it will make you stronger.

### 2. [Video: How to do pullups if you can't do any](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eLjb-iXpxWE)

* In part two, I demonstrate how to **perform negative pullups properly,** emphasizing *the importance of lifting/tucking the knees up as you lower down so that your feet dont hit the ground before your arms are straight.* Your goal is to do 10-second negatives.

* If you can't control the negative, then you need to work on your rows (incline rows to be exact) which are an easier pulling exercise and a prerequisite for pullups. In the RR, we recommend you get to 3 sets of 8 reps ("3x8") of horizontal rows before moving to the pullup progression.

* If you are unsure how or where to do rows, review the video on [bodyweight rows here](https://youtu.be/rloXYB8M3vU).

I hope that helps! Please feel free to ask questions and leave feedback!
