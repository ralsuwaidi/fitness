**Stats:** 45, 5'5", 120lbs (I was born into extreme poverty and malnourished as a child, which stunted my growth)

**Goal:** To stay healthy, fit, and active for as long as possible, while avoiding injuries and minimizing impact/stress to joints.

**Diet:** Primarily plant based (with lots of beans for protein!), and occasional fish/seafood (2-4 times/month). No meat otherwise, and no dairy (except for the rare ice cream treat; a pint can last months in my freezer). I've been doing 16:8 intermittent fasting for many years now, and am thoroughly loving it (it's not for everyone, so always check with a medical professional before you make any significant changes to your lifestyle).

**Supplements:** None, except for daily calcium & Omega 3 pills.

**Sleep:** 6 hours a day, plus post-work naps as needed.

**Misc:** Never drank, smoked, or used drugs. Don't like coffee/tea. I do enjoy the occasional smoothie, but otherwise primarily drink water.

**Workout routine:**

* Monday/Wednesday/Friday - 50 min cardio (10K run on elliptical using HIIT program, getting my peak heart rate into the 170s)

* Tuesday - arms/back/abs (3 sets of ~15 reps each)

        Arms:
        * barbell curl
        * one arm cable curls
        * reverse curl
        * chin-ups

        Back:
        * lat pulldown
        * back extension machine
        * pull ups
        * vertical row

        Abs:
        * hanging leg raises
        * ab crunches
        * decline crunches

* Thursday - legs/abs (3 sets of ~15 reps each)

        Legs:
        * quad extension
        * hamstring curls
        * leg press machine
        * calf machines (standing & seated)

* Saturday - chest/triceps/abs (3 sets of ~15 reps each)

        Chest:
        * flat bench press
        * incline bench press
        * decline bench press
        * chest fly machine
        * dips

        Notes: I don't use heavy weights in my bench presses since I'm not a powerlifter and I don't have a workout partner to spot me, so I've incorporated more exercises to compensate.

        Triceps:
        * triceps pushdown
        * dumbell kickback
        * overhead triceps extension

**Other thoughts:** 

Still feeling great at 45, and am proud to have successfully maintained a 28" waist size since my 20s despite working a full time desk job. I try to view food as fuel for my body rather than a treat for my taste buds, and I only eat when I feel hungry (I'm too lazy to count calories). I don't skip workouts unless I'm injured/sick/contagious. [Consistency](https://i.imgur.com/FW4dnBP.png) is key, but listen closely to your body, and go light on weights or take a break from a certain exercise if needed. Be sure to watch that form! Also, take good care of your teeth! I'm lucky to still have all mine, and I brush/floss/waterpik every day, plus I never skip a dentist visit.

Try to minimize stress in your life by being financially responsible and living below your means, and seek help for issues that you have trouble dealing with on your own. Simplify, simplify, simplify! Remove toxic people and non-value added activities from your life, and focus your energy on the things in your [circle of control](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/10/07/how-big-is-your-circle-of-control/). You will be much healthier and happier!

Edit: Wow, this blew up. I forgot to mention, stretching is extremely important to me! I always stretch prior to working out, and I feel it has been beneficial to me so far. Also, this is just what has personally worked for me. I'm not a definitive authority on health and fitness, I just wanted to share my story. You should find what works for you, and stick with it. Cheers!
