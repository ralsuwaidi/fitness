Please read the imgur album. Ill answer any questions if they are asked in the comments below. Im in a sling so I cant be super detailed as I would like, but ill try my best! Just wanted to share my progress thus far. Enjoy. 



DIET: Year 1: Atkins diet (low carb). All I did was track how many carbs I would eat, aimed to stay below 40g a day. lost 80lbs this way.
Year 2: Starvation. ate 0-500cals a day. lost about 40lbs this way In a few months. hated it. don't do it haha. 
Year 2.5/Current: Macros. 2k cals, 200g protein 200g carbs, 45g fats. LOVE THIS! Not only do I get to eat all types of food, I eat for fuel! nothing I eat goes to waste... if I don't workout that day, I don't eat as much. I recommend doing this due to how you don't hate life on this diet. 

Gym: Mondays back. Tuesday chest. Wednesday legs. Thursday shoulders. Friday arms. I have a slideshow that entails what I do on each of these days, that I have shared with a lot of friends and family. feel free to take a look, very simple to understand. great for beginners imo. I will be making adjustments in the near future to it. https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rW5NQ7WD7J_x8csxL2ZyNpk2Iop2CEUObjC-8URtuik/edit?usp=docslist_api
