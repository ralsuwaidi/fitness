Thought I might share these two videos that have helped me fix my posture. I sit a lot and didn't notice how bad sitting had affected my posture before trying out these things. 

The [first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT_dFRnmdGs) I used a long time ago every day and got lazy with it eventually, but it works very well for fixing your forward head posture. 


The [second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vOgxWp0WyiI) method is one I'm currently using, and although I've only been doing it for a couple of days, I notice big improvement. It basically teaches you to use your posterior chain as you stand up and move in everyday life. After doing this for only a few days it's amazing how I didn't know how fucked up my posture was and what sitting at the computer for hours was doing to me.. and I'm so glad I found it.
