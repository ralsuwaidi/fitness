TLDR; I was unhappy and now I am happy. Do what works for you, but this is my journey!
 
BACKSTORY (not pictured): I was a skinny kid until I hit puberty and went from skin and bones to fat, my heaviest I've weighed was 73kgs (I'm 5'7") or 160lbs and I was so so unhappy. At the end of high school I hurt my body, was depressed and ended up just not eating. I dropped about 20kgs or 45lbs in just under a year. I lost A LOT of weight, my period, but I gained what I though was happiness.
 
DIET: basically a whole jar of nutella erryday.
WEIGHT: 73kgs / 160lbs

MOVING LEFT TO RIGHT
FIRST PIC: was taken in 2014, just before my 21st birthday.
 
I was starving myself, unhappy and struggling with depression. My skin was tired and you could see all of my ribs, but I was bloated 100% of the time and had severe reactions to eating wheat / dairy because I had restricted them from my diet for so long. I had literally given myself an intolerance to food.
 
I was a cardio whore, and did nothing but HIIT workouts or long 10km + walks, I didn't know anything about strength training and thought you achieved the 'perfect body' by eating nothing and working out 24/7.
 
I remained this way for over 2 years!!!!!!! :O
 
DIET: lots and lots of salads, low fat yogurt, and high protein, fruit but still low carb
WEIGHT: 52kgs - 56kgs / 120lbsish
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
SECOND PIC: taken about a year ago, I was going to the gym and did HIIT workouts both in classes (like body pump) or on my own. I gained confidence to start making my own workouts, but still though cardio was the only way to look long and lean. I wanted a six pack so so so bad! I was still terrified of eating carbs, and I would think about eating all the time - perpetually hungry and getting nowhere.
 
DIET: carbs in my breakfast, i.e. muesli but pretty much the same as the above. But I was eating MORE of it
WEIGHT: 58kgs
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
THIRD PIC: taken January 2017. Old habits die hard, I had just gotten back from a 4 week trip to Canada and the US. I thought I would get fat by enjoying christmas a little toooo much so I restricted my eating. I got horribly sick with a few chest / ear infections, and was walking around 25kms per day - obviously not good for the body and I'm so sad that I did this.
 
DIET: I was eating out every day basically for a month, and was enjoying noodle soups, bagels and chocolate - but wasn't eating a ton
WEIGHT: not sure, but roughly around 57kgs
 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
FOURTH PIC: taken in May 2017. My best friend has been doing weights for a few years now, and had encouraged me to give it a go. I was skeptical at first but I LOVED the way my body felt, strong and sexy so I switched gyms and we started going daily. We both made a commitment to eating MORE food, including a healthy portion of carbs with EVERY meal and to keeping each other on tracker. I was eating around 2300 calories per day
 
DIET: we slowly INCREASED CARB INTAKE from around Feb 2017 onwards (still going lols), to try and REPAIR YEARS OF DAMAGE that we had already done.
I would eat a mostly large carb / protein breakfast - large as I workout in the morning only - yes I wake up at 5AM, and yes I sleep by 9PM :) I would eat carbs and lunch and then mostly protein and whatever fats I had left over
I was tracking macros to make sure I was EATING ENOUGH, and not convince myself that I didn't need to eat things
I started enjoying chocolate, and savory food - can you believe that I thought making a cheeesy sandwich would kill me and now I devour about 10million a week?
WEIGHT: 60kgs /  132lbs

FINAL PIC: taken today. I'm happy, I'm healthy. I feel full and strong. I can squat 150lbs 4x10, deadlift 1RM 100kgs and can run for miles. I can do chin ups and the abs are slowly poking through as I do a mini mini cut for summer (I live in Aust). My butt is finally cooperating and stubbornly growing cm by cm.
 
I lift about 5 days a week, following a body upper and lower (2x LOWER and 2 x UPPER /  1x whatever I feel like). I ride my bike to and from work, or walk. I enjoy my strength and am keen to see where I am in a year's time from now.
 
DIET: I've just started a mini mini cut, so sitting at around 1800 calories per day. I eat around 150 C, 140 P, 70 F but really just eat whatever I feel like and don't count calories. I used to be terrified of carbs, but now they make up for the most of my meals and my body responds so well. Yes I gained some fat, but it's SOOOO much easier to lose now I know what I am doing. 
It's about eating in a deficit or surplus, nothing else. Forget carbs, protein and fat. You either eat MORE or LESS than you need - but make sure you do it safely as it has taken years to realize.
WEIGHT: 65kgs (AND I HAVE ABS) yes, real abs poking through
 
TLDR;  I was unhappy and now I am happy. Do what works for you, but this is my journey!
 
I've written a wall of text but I wish someone had told me this stuff in the beginning, but then again what's life without a few mistakes?
