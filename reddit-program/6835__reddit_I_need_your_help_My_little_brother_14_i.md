I wrote out a giant fucking essay but I was just venting and nobody wants to hear that so, I'll just write the key points here.

- Mom is fat, doesn't work, doesn't excerise, eats a lot of junk food. Chips, candy, deepfried snacks, ice cream sundaes, etc. 

- Mom has no comprehension of what "healthy" means. Taco salad made of Tostitos chips for dinner? = healthy. Gummy candies say they are made with fruit? = healthy. Massive ice cream sundae + waffle bowl + [this stuff](http://images.smuckers.ca/images/products/1/product_297.jpg) (she calls it jam) with fruit on top? = healthy! "it's fruit! the rest is just to make it taste good!". Wonder bread, sunny D, hamburger helper, sugary cereals, frozen pizza - all are "healthy"! 

- Little brother, 14, eats what my mom serves him. In many cases this is WAY too much food. The lunches/dinners aren't too bad, it's the fucking snacks she makes him that are making him huge. He is constantly eating, because she is constantly eating. If she makes herself something, she will make two and give one to my younger brother. Usually this is: a bag of popcorn (each), 200g bag of chips (each), ice cream, lots of 'little' things like those red white and blue space popsicles or bags of gold fish crackers. 

- HONESTLY my little brother doesn't give a shit about any of this stuff, he just eats what he's given. If you don't offer him anything he won't ask for it, but what 14 year old is going to turn down a bowl of ice cream?

- I have tried talking to my mom rationally about this stuff. It doesn't work. Her habits and lifestyle are pretty set and I really don't think I'm going to change her. I've even gone so far as documenting all of the food my brother ate one day, breaking down the nutritional information, and presenting it to my mom. (4200 calories. 6 hours spent watching TV after school). She dismissed it.

#What can I do? 


I try to lead by example. I eat healthy, and offer to cook healthy meals for my whole family. Sometimes my mom accepts, other times she firmly tells me "no, I'm making X for dinner." and if I feed my brother anyway she'll just feed him more. 

I have a gym membership and casually brought up the idea of "hey, you should come to the gym today!" to my brother. It seemed to make him nervous/scared. He is very insecure about his weight. 

I should point out that my little brother and I are good friends. We hang out, laugh, and interact a lot. It's a very positive relationship.

All advice is welcome.

Edit: I'm 21, male. I live away from home while in school but am home for the summer.

Edit2: Holy shit, woke up to 900 comments. Thank you everyone, I will read through them all.
