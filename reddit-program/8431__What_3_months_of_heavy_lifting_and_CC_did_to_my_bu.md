Hello everyone!

To the girls out there scared of heavy lifting I hope my post can convince you you shouldn't be! 

Here are pictures of my progress after I followed a 3 month program where I lifted heavy, heavy, HEAVY weights 5 times a week:

To be completely honest I feel GREAT. I feel so strong! One of the first things I noticed is that I'm never tired anymore when I carry 6 bags from the supermarket, lol. I just feel so full of energy! And I must say that that has been *the* best thing of all. It has now been a year since the change above and I look the same, I have maintained both my weight/muscle-mass by going to the gym 1-2 (I haven't calorie-counted since) 

For those that want to know
**here are my measurements:**

| HOW I DID IT |
|:--| 


I decided to start heavy lifting after one very kind person in /r/fitness (shoutout to you /u/sknick_) recommended a very wonderful fitness-author to me. After reading a bit about him, I bought his book dedicated to heavy lifting for amateur women. It detailed everything about weight-lifting/weight loss from the beginning, and I was so thrilled I decided to follow the program to the T!



**The exact program I followed during the 3 months**


| Day  | Excersizes    
|:-----------|------------:|
|     **Monday** -  Chest and Abs |          Bench Press (3 sets, 4-6 reps)
 |Incline Bench press (3 sets, 4-6 reps)
 |Dumbell Incline Bench Press (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |Dips (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |Cable Crunch (3 sets, 15-20 reps)
 |Leg Raises (3 sets to failure)
 |Air Bikes (3 sets to failure)
 |------------------------------------------------------|      
|     **Tuseday**  - Back  |          Barbell Deadlifts (3 sets, 4-6 reps)
 |Barbell Bent over Row (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |Dumbell one arm row (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |Close grup Front lateral pulldown (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |------------------------------------------------------| 
|     **Wednesday**  - Shoulders  |          Military Press (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |Barbell up right Row (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |Lateral Raise (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |Dumbell Bent Over Delt Raise (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |------------------------------------------------------|
|     **Thursday**  - Arms  |          Dumbbell alternative Bicep curl (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |Tricep pushdown (V-Bar) (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |Barbell Curl (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |Dumbell seated Tricep Press (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |------------------------------------------------------|  
|     **Friday**  - Legs  |          Barbell Squat (3 sets, 4-6 reps)
 |Leg Press Machine (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |Romanian Deadlift (3 sets, 8-10 reps)
 |------------------------------------------------------| 

These workouts take around 45/60 minutes each (so not so much!). 

**HIIT-training**: In addition to these gym session I did High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) in the form of running 3 times a week, each session being 20 minute. 
(HIIT-jogging: You jog for a minute, sprint for 30-60 seconds, jog another minute, jog for 30-60 seconds again etc. until you reach around 20 minutes. There are great free apps for this type of workout, for example "HIIT interval training timer")

------------------------


**Calorie Counting**

As I wanted to get leaner I cut during these 3 months (I was at a calorie deficiency). To calculate what my daily macors (fats/proteins/carbohydrates) and calories should be for good weight-loss, I used the following formula for my starting weight (also taken from the book).

1. Eat 1.2 grams of protein per pound of body weight each day
2. Eat 1 gram of carbs per body weight each day
3. Eat 0.2 grams of fats per body weight each day

For me that became 163 grams of protein per day (1,2 grams *136 lbs), 136 grams of carbohydrates per day (1 gram *136 lbs) and 27 grams of fat per day (0,2 grams *136 lbs).

You then use these values to count your daily calorie intake. 1 carb is 4 calories, 1 protein is 4 calories and one fat is 9 calories. 
I calculated about 1300 calories per day, which I followed exactly during those months.

--------------------------------------

And that's all I did! Simply put my body feels great now and just filled with power. When I run I feel springy on my feet, when I play with my friends and family I use my body with joy because it feels so strong. And that is something I want to convey. Not only is heavy lifting a great way to get lean/look good if that is your main concern, but the changes to the *feeling* of your body is amazing. One of the best decisions I have made in my life :) The 3 months was an intense workout-effort, but once you get there maintaining what you achieved takes very little effort! (I go to the gym 1-2 a week and that's it, I look more or less the same as when I just finished the intense training period now one year later. When I maintain I go once a week with the following excersizes (also taken from the author): Squats *(3 sets, 4-6 reps)*, Deadlift *(3 sets, 4-6 reps)*, Bench Press *(3 sets, 4-6 reps)*, Barbell Row *(3 sets, 8-10 reps)*, Military Press *(3 sets, 4-6 reps)*


My purpose with posting is to perhaps help some other girls/guys out there like /u/sknick_ / helped me, and show them the amazing progress that is possible with weight-lifting!
 
Thanks for looking guys! If you have any questions hit me :)

**EDIT:** Thank you all for your wonderful words, and I'm thrilled to have inspired so many! :) I hope you all take amazing progress-shots, and share them!!!

To those of you who have PM'd me about the book, I was told by moderators that I had to remove any mention of the name of the author or his book if I wanted to keep the post up (The reasoning behind it is that it could be "promoting"/spamming). It's extremely unfortunate, as all the material I am quoting is his and not mine. I thought about it and in the end seeing how the post has been so appreciated by the community I decided it would be the lesser of two evil (between deleting the post, or deleting the author's name). However I don't feel really feel comfortable about it, so I don't know if I will leave the post up. 

Anyway thank you so much again! You can always ask in the comment-section and I will happily answer! :)

PEACE OUT
