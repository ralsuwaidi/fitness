**[M, 39, SW: 407.8lbs, Weight Before Skin Surgery: 194lbs, CW 199.2lbs]**

EDIT: Im 6'2", I realized I didn't have that in here.

This will be my final post on this unless something major happens in the future. Once again, I want to thank /r/Fitness  for all the support you've given me this past year, I truly appreciate it and hope I can repay it in kind.

**TL;DWTR (aka I've got a minute, give me the juicy details):**

So, it has been 1 year since I hit my 200lbs loss, ~9 months since I got below 200lbs for the first time in my adult life, and just over 6 months since I underwent skin removal surgery where the removed ~244 sq inches of skin. To make it short, it has been one crazy year. This post is both an update for all of the above, plus an update on my diet/exercise plan (as per the rules).

The surgery went well, but as you can see from the photos I'm kind of lopsided. My right side did not turn out as well as my left. As far as weight, I have maintained my 200lbs weight loss throughout the entire surgery, recovery and now as I work to regain what strength/muscle I lost.

Below is a VERY abbreviated backstory, the original is still [available here](https://ap.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5lioa6/m3862_4078_2072_200lbs_weight_loss/) and the second [update is here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/5wpxhb/update_goal_reached_m3862_4078_1996lbs_2082lbs/)

**Quick Background:**

I won't rehash the whole story again as the original posts from last year are still available, links below. 

​When I was a kid I was told I would never be fat. By the time I graduated from High School I was ~320lbs. Starting my Junior year of college I moved to main campus, weighing about 390, and reached 400+ by end of the 1st year on campus. Second year on campus was when I reached my recorded max of 407.8lbs. It is likely that I weighed more, but the 407.8 figure is the highest I found logged by a medical office, so it is the one I use.


*****************************************
*****************************************

**Diet:** 

For the 2 years I have stuck to IIFYM, which is, in my humble opinion, the best out of the options I've personally tried. Approximately, 1800-1900 cals/day cutting. After the surgery I was told I had to eat, so I reverse dieted to 2000 to aid recovery. But this translated into "eat all the foods" since I didn't really have anything else to do. This did put some fat back on me since all I could do was sit and walk short distances. But I did maintain the 200lbs loss for a year now and have never crossed back into that.

I shoot for 130g of food-based protein, minimum, regardless of diet or supplementation. Even on cheat days. But I usually get more like 180g a day.

Fat is usually under 45g/day, carbs make up the rest.

Typical Meals:

* **Breakfast:** 60g Oatmeal sweetened w/ Splenda, 4 piece of toast from Heiner's 35 calorie bread
* **Pre-Workout:** Large Apple
* **Lunch:** 8oz chicken breast, 250g sweet potato.
* **Protein Bar** Rarely, but I prefer ones that don't go under a 10cal:1g protein ratio. (eg. 200cal bar w/ 20g protein)
* **Dinner:** 6-8oz Lean meat, veggies, and I end the day's eating @ 6-7pm with a single serving protein pancake w/ SF syrup. Kodiak Dark Chocolate is hands down the best IMO.

I don't personally believe in supplementation. Just a personal thing. But, I will drink some Myprotein-brand BCAAs after a particularly difficult workout, but nothing else. I do occasionally use protein powder, but it is usually to cook with, not drink, and when I do get some it is usually Myprotein or ON brand.

**Exercise:** 

My approach to fitness, given my age, is functional with a heavy slant on looking decent. I would like to have abs just one time in my life, just to look like the classic "male." However, over the last few weeks I have realized that I just wasn't putting my all into it. I realize that, technically, I am still recovering from a massive surgery where the front of my body was split in twain. But, I never get sore anymore, I rarely mix up my exercises. I didn't add in new ones. I did a strict split and just tried to put up more weight. I told myself that *insert exercises I was good at* exercises is what I could do due to *insert BS excuse here* and never pushed forward.

Then I met a good friend of mine, who is 18 years old. 21 years my junior, a local soccer star, cross country State finalist, and still hits the gym everyday. He pushes me harder than anyone I have ever met, refuses the "nonsense" of my age until I have actually tried something new. It reminds me of my niece who always says "I don't like that" when you offer something new to eat. For me it's "Im too old/weak/recovering for that." He doesn't accept that until I have tried. If I could give any tip to someone new to this fitness/weight loss world it would be to find someone who doesn't take excuses. Not because you are paying them, but because they honestly know you well enough to see past the excuses, to see the person you could be.

Over the last few weeks I have been fine tuning a new program, it is still in progress but this is pretty close to the final plan. The idea was to move away from a regular split to something that mimicked a 2 day/wk split while making it accessible for someone who doesn't have the recovery ability of a 20 year old. Plus, adding in more functional movements and core to each day versus a dedicated day. **Each day is a Heavy/Light split, the Heavy area being the main focus of the day and the Light being a secondary day, but no reduction in weight, just a reduced number of exercises.** 

**Split:**

I don't have a set rep/set pattern for any exercise other than **10 reps for the first 2 sets of any exercise, then all additional sets are to failure.** Average range of sets is 4-8, depending on the exercise, weight, etc.

* **Monday** is Heavy Chest / Light Back + Chinups, Pushups, 3x Core Exercises 
* **Tuesday** is Heavy Core / Light Legs + Pushups, Chinups, 2x Bicep Exercises
* **Weds** is Heavy Back / Light Chest +  Pushups, Vacuums, 2x Core Exercises 
* **Thursday** is Deadlifts, Rackpulls, Pullovers, Pushups, 3x Core Exercises, Chinups
* **Friday** is Heavy Shoulders / Light Arms + Pushups, Asst. Pullups, 3x Core exercises 
* **Sat** is Heavy Legs (focused) then Light Full Body (more or less I workout various things, all to failure, while I chat and enjoy the day) + Iso Bicep Exercises
* **Sun** is Rest Day

**Breakdown of Exercises:**

* **Chest:** Chest Press (Machine), Landmine Press, Sven Press, Flat Bench, Incline Bench

* **Back:** Machine Rows, Lat Pulldown, T-bar Row, Iso Low-Row, Cable Mid-Row, Lat Pressdown, Australian Pullups, DB Shrugs, I/T/Y/Ws, DB Rows, Lumbar Hyperextensions, Robbery Exercise w/ 20lb DBs
* **Core:** Core Twist, Flutter Kicks, Reverse Crunches, Oblique Crunches, V holds, V Ball Passes, Ab-Pullovers, Hanging Leg Lift, L-Sit, Roman Chair Crunches
* **Legs:** High Bar Squat, Goblet Squat, Air Squat, Barbell Calf Press, Leg Extensions, Glute Kickback Machine, Hamstring Curls, Glute Thrusts, Abd/Add Press, Leg Press
* **Shoulders:** DB Scap Holds, Dislocations, DB OHP, BB OHP, Lateral Raises, Plate Raises, Plate Steering (use a plate like a steering wheel)
* **Bicep/Tricep:** Standing DB Curl, Preacher Curls, Iso DB Curls, Cable Curls, Drag Curls, Hammer Curls, Tricep Pushdown, Tricep Cable Extension, Internal/External Rotator Cuff Cable Pulls

Again, these are all the same format. **10 reps for 2 sets, then everything else to failure with no hard set range.** Average is 4-8 sets, depends on exercise, weight, etc. Deadlifts are the odd man out, it is 5 reps each set, no set limits, just until I can't do it anymore or form breaks down. Usually it's 6-10 sets depending on weight progression.

The Mods asked me to elaborate on the weight progression of my fitness plan. Given my age I'm not really chasing the same dreams that the younger people are so my progression is more tailored to overall fitness. When I start a new exercise I find a weight that I can do 4-6 sets with, to failure each set, and that is where I start. However, this is not a hard and fast rule, some days as I start increasing the weight through the sets I get worn out and don't progress in weight that week. My goal is to push to failure each and every time. Overall I feel this gives a better workout for me and seems to still allow decent recovery.

As an example, I logged my previous deadlift day.

* **Set 1:** 95lbs x 21 reps
* **Set 2:** 115lbs x 17reps
* **Set 3:** 135lbs x 13reps
* **Set 4:** 185lbs x 10reps
* **Set 5:** 205lbs x 6 reps
* **Set 6:** 235lbs x 4 reps
* **Set 7:** 235lbs x 3 reps

I do log my workouts, but I don't track # of reps. I only track that I did a set to failure, how many sets I did total, and the maximum weight used. This is done by putting an X or a dot next to exercise which denotes a completed set. Then at the end I write down the maximum weight used across the exercise.

**Cardio:** 

I have slowly added in either **sprint cardio** (Sprints on the Treadmill Usually) or some **long slow cardio** (Stair Climber is still my favorite). I do this **3-4 days a week and I do at least 2x 2-minute Sprints every day but Saturday.**

I also do rehab-given exercises for shoulders, knees, and back to maintain the health of those areas. Those are just peppered in throughout the week. I won't list these here, **if you have an injury, see a doctor/physio.**

Yes, it is a lot each day. But I tend to thrive on a meticulously laid out plans. Plus, if I over-shoot in the plan, then Ill either overachieve daily or at least hit the mark in execution.

I've only been lifting heavy again for about 2.5 months between the surgery and my shoulder. So these are my horribly weak, Post Recovery Lifts (these are for reps of 3 of more, not 1RM)

* **Flat bench:** 155lbs
* **Squat:** 155lbs
* **Deadlift:** 235lbs

**Extras:**

I like to hike/backpack, swim for distance, and I run on the rare occasion, but aside from the gym I don't do much in the way of sports.

​**Whats Next:**

You can stamp a big "VAIN" on my forehead, but I want freaking abs. Just once. Also traps.

My gym mates and I just finished a 6 week "Add-On" plan I developed where we did vacuums and pushups every morning. I went from barely being able to do 15 pushups to easily being able to bust out 40-45 in one go. Everyone whined about the vacuums after the first 3 days, but now they are thanking me, it really is an undervalued exercise. Now that is done, I am planning to focus on my posture and my shoulders. I have some kyphosis in the upper back from years of being a computer geek then later a WoW nerd. So, I want to correct my posture as much as I can, which will translate into better, stronger shoulders.

I am also going to have to try and figure out how to get the other 1 or 2 skin removals I will need to look "normal". My rear flanks/love-handle area will absolutely need fixed and my chest will likely need to be fixed. Until that point, I will continue to lose fat and get as functionally strong as I can get.

**FAQ**

* Are you going to lose any more weight?

>My plastic surgeon has recommended I go down to 185, but no lower. At that point I should be focused on more of a recomp. As you can see from the pictures, there is still fat under the skin. I need to get rid of as much of that as I can.

* Did you have surgery or use any drugs/medicine/chemicals?

>​No. Nothing against them, I just feel the "quick" (but, clearly not painless) methods available lack a certain educational value to them. Sure, I can teach someone the techniques to keep off the 100lbs they lost from weight loss surgery, but actually living it for years, dealing with failures/obstacles, is nearly always the best teacher.

* What's next?

>I'd still like to climb a mountain. Maybe Mt. Rainier or Mt. Elbert?​ Something with proper snow and requires a bit of technical climbing.​ I'v​e ​always been a bit of an armchair mountaineer. A friend of mine climbed Kilimanjaro about a year after a dual cervical fusion, plus he is 12 years older than me, so what is and isn't possible for me kind of has been thrown out the window.

* Did you ever consider suicide?

>I put this on every update I do, or anything I post connected with weight loss. The answer is yes I have, on a few occasions, not my finest moments. **If you are considering suicide, PLEASE get help, there are lots of options for help, regardless of where you are in the world. You might think suicide will stop what you are currently feeling, but it also robs you of everything you could be. In the US you can call 1-800-273-8255, 911, or go to the nearest Emergency Room.
