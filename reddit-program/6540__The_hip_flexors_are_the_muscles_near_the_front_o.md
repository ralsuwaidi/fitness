[In this follow-along video,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGEpQ1BRx-4) I share with you the intricacies that turn the lunge into a **very effective** stretch for your hip flexors which are the muscles at the front of the thigh/hips. The muscles such as the [rectus femoris](https://i.imgur.com/BwwQ7Qb.jpg) and the [iliopsoas complex.](https://i.imgur.com/h3jMuSd.jpg))

##**Benefits:** 

* For people who sit a lot and don't stretch the hip flexors, they have often lost all hip extension and need to restore it. Stretching the hip flexors will help your hips **have more hip extension** (read: the ability to bring your thighs behind you without arching the lower back to compensate). 

* Lunges are a commonly prescribed basic stretch if someone is having lower back pain, because the iliopsoas complex (deep hip flexor) connects the thighs to the lower back, and if they're tight they pull on the lower back. Doing it in a low lunge is a very good start toward stretching them.

* The cues in the video (squaring, tucking, etc) are applicable to **ALL** hip flexor stretches, including high/standing lunges or the couch/wall quad stretch and so forth.

###Edit: If you had trouble listening to the video cause the background music was too loud, [here's the version without background music.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NITPD0beV74)

**tl;dw:** I teach you how to square the hips (remember, it's always back-hip forward, front-hip backward), then my favorite way of getting people to tuck the hips (posteriorly tilt the hips using your hands) and small but important details like making sure the back foot is in line with the mat/carpet and the front foot is ahead of the knee and so on.
