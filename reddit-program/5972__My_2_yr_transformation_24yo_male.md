I grew up being a fat kid my whole life. Up until I was about 18. I tried to avoid any kind of physical activities since I wasn't good at any sports nor interested.


Right before I finished high school, one of my friends asked me if I wanted to go to a gym with him and I just went without knowing what to expect. My first day at the gym was horrible. I remember using two 35lbs dumbbells to do a flat bench dumbbell press and thinking I was going to pass out after the 3rd rep. Since then, I've always been in and out of the gym. I did the typical bro split (chest/tris, back/bis, and etc). I didn't know what I was doing but since I was somewhat consistent, I didn't look "fat" anymore. Fast forward to summer of 2014, my clinical depression (got diagnosed way back in the day so I've had it pretty much my whole life) hit me harder than usual and I just dropped everything. I flunked all my classes, ate whatever &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;whenever and  slept when I wasn't eating. Fast forward to December 2014, I went to my mom's house for Christmas dinner and decided to weigh myself to find out that I gained 35lbs in span of 5 months(and I wasn't working out at all during that time so I'm assuming it was 35lbs + how much ever muscle mass I lost).



I decided that enough was enough and started dieting again on New Years. For diet, I carb cycles which worked really well with my carb cravings and 3 day split that I was running. I didn't really count my calories since I was tracking my macros instead but it usually went like this.

My macros were:
Day1(rest) 50c/30f/200p (1250-1300kcal)
Day2(push) 150c/30f/200p (1800-1950kcal)
Day3(pull) 150c/30f/200p (1800-1950 kcal)
Day4(legs) 300c/60f/200p (2200kcal)

Every 8th day of my high carb day, I had a "cheat meal" but tried to stay on healthier side instead of binging on calorie condensed food (deep fried, sweets, and etc. but I did treat myself to milkshakes from time to time). I didn't really do any cardio during my cut just because I was lazy.

I ran this for a while but also took time away from dieting when I was on vacation and enjoying summer. From fall of 2015 until August of 2016, I fluctuated back and forth between 185-195. In September, I was sitting at 185, not happy with how much mass I had I decided to "mini-bulk" up to 195 before cutting again. I'm not sure if that bulk did much at all but I started my cut again in October same carb cycling but upping my fat to 60 per day while dropping my protein according to my body weight.

Routine now: https://bodymaxing.com/2016/09/15/dltbb-routine/

I'm sitting at 179-180lbs right now hoping to cut maybe 5lbs before I reverse diet or maintain. But I'm pretty happy with my result so far. It took me longer than some people's transformation, but I enjoyed myself when I wanted to and made it work with on my own time. Someone once told me, "your fitness journey is not a sprint, but a marathon. So as long as you stay consistent and never give up. You'll get to your destination." And it really helped me out a lot when I was in doubt or feeling down with how I looked.

Thank you for reading and again, sorry about the format and grammar.

Edit: whoa, thank you all for compliments, advices and just responding in general. I didn't expect this post to blow up!

Yes, my mirror is dirty... I do clean it often, but when I wash my face, I splash water everywhere... I'll clean it more often ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.

My hair looks horrible in my before pics because they were all pre shower hair + bed hair. I have the same haircut I just style it different depending on how long it gets. Here are some pics if you are interested. https://imgur.com/a/PGfuN
