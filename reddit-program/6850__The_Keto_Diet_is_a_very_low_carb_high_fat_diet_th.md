* I recently published a comprehensive guide for people who have never heard of the keto diet or want to know more. This was very well received [on /r/keto](https://redd.it/4vhrv5) and I'm sure /r/fitness would benefit as well from this information because diet is one of the most powerful and effective changes we could make to manage our health.

* **I tried to do my best to make sure I portrayed this diet in a responsible, well-rounded manner with all the pros/cons so here goes:**

Edit: The post was removed due to some [self-promotion rules.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/self_promotion)  SO I must adhere to them by probably summarizing the content of a 9000 word article. Okay so here goes:

###What is the ketogenic (keto) diet?

The ketogenic diet is not intended to be a temporary diet for weight loss, although it works great for that, but it is more of a lifestyle change where you consistently and drastically reduce the amount of carbs you ingest. It not only makes you burn fat for energy (more on that below) but helps you become very aware of how rampant and ubiquitous carbs are in this day and age.

###Why is it called ketogenic?

* The word ketogenic is made up of two words: keto- and -genic.
* The prefix “keto-” is short for ketones.
* The suffix “-genic” is the same as genesis, which refers to “the creation of something”
* So the word ketogenic literally means the “creation of ketones.”
* Ketones are created from the break down of fat for energy when the body doesn’t get enough carbs.
* When the body is creating ketones, it is said to be in a state of ketosis where fat becomes the main source of fuel for energy rather than sugar (glycolysis).

###What the fuck are ketones?

Ketones are like water-soluble fat molecules that can cross the blood-brain-barrier and provide energy for the brain.  There is this myth where people say that you MUST eat carbs because the brain can only survive off carbs or glucose. What they don’t know (or conveniently forget to mention) is that the brain operates perfectly on ketones as well.  Think of them as the 4th macronutrient after carbs, protein and fat.

### How is ketosis achieved?

Ketosis is achieved by practicing strict carbohydrate restriction consistently. The general limit is about 25-50grams of net carbs a day which is far lower than the typical 200-300grams most people ingest per day.  (Net carbs are carbs minus fiber.) Those carbs must be replaced with healthy fat sources. It takes a few days for ketosis to actually occur because you have a glycogen supply to get through initially, but one can reach ketosis faster if they exercise.

Note: One can also reach ketosis if they starve themselves completely of all foods, but that is not ideal or recommended. What we're after is not starvational ketosis but nutritional ketosis which is achieved in the same fashion by simply restricting carbs.

###What are the benefits of being in ketosis?

The promises of a ketogenic diet are quite impressive:

* Helpful for metabolic syndrome (obesity) and preventing diabetes
* Increased meal satiety and appetite blunting. This diet is more satiating than a low-fat diet and tends to makes it easier to avoid caloric overconsumption.
* Greater rate of fat loss due to state of ketosis rather than glycolysis.
* Note: You literally become a fat-burning machine.
* Reduction or complete elimination of Type-2 Diabetes (Reduction in insulin resistance)
* Reduction or complete elimination of hypertension (high blood pressure).
* Improved lipid fat profile: LDL (the bad cholesterol) particle size increases which is a good thing. (The smaller ones cause more damage.)
 * [The SIZE of LDL particles may be more important than concentration of LDL cholesterol.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20531184)
 * Recent studies have shown independent relationships of levels of LDL size to risk of heart disease.
* [Prevention of various cancers and reduction of cancer growths.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3267662/#!po=0.217391)
 * The mitochondria of cancer cells are damaged and require 200x the normal amounts of glucose to replicate at rapid rates. They cannot utilize ketones and cannot survive in ketosis without the presence of excess glucose.
* [Possible treatment for Alzheimers.](http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1743-7075-6-31.pdf) ([another study\)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19090989)
* [Possible treatment for Parkinsons](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15728303)
* [Improved memory for older adults](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21130529)
* [Reduction or complete elimination of chronic systemic inflammation.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3267662/#!po=0.217391)
* A ketogenic diet has profoundly anti-inflammatory effects.
* [Improved cardiovascular health](http://jn.nutrition.org/content/132/7/1879.abstract)
* Very high muscle-sparing effect. (Muscle loss is mitigated in ketosis even at a caloric deficit!)
* Proven treatment for epilepsy, more effective than current medications without the side effects.

You can extrapolate that if it’s helping reverse the diseased conditions of people with Type 2 diabetes, cancer, heart disease, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s and so forth, that it may PROACTIVELY help those of us who are not afflicted by those conditions and want to avoid them!

###Before I continue: The ketogenic diet is NOT a panacea

The truth is that there is not a single, perfect diet that works for everybody.  In regards to this diet specifically, [Dom D’agostino](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yWRnma8Tet0) says that this diet is excellent for ~70% of people out there but ~30% of the population does not respond well to this diet. Btw, Dom D’agostino is the expert that originally got me hooked to trying keto. He calls ketones the 4th macronutrient in[ this podcast with Tim Ferris.](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/11/03/dominic-dagostino/)

* Weight loss is NOT guaranteed on keto. You still need to be wary of your total intake of calories and counting your calories/macros is recommended until you figure out the diet. But after a lot of experience, many people find the keto diet to be liberating because they are able to maintain the diet without the need for calorie counting by consistently choosing only keto-friendly foods.

###Why do you have to restrict the carbs so sharply? How does the body transition to burning fats for energy?

I wrote a ton on that topic and I'm just summarizing here so here's a tl;dr infographic: http://i.imgur.com/HeEYexT.png

###So… What are carbohydrates?

Carbs are sugar. Sugars are carbs.  There are simple carbs (monosaccharides) and complex carbs (polysaccharides). There are also sugars found naturally in foods and extra sugars added artificially to foods. In the context of a ketogenic diet, they’re all pretty much the same because the body eventually breaks them down into their simplest forms regardless. (The carbs that you will eat will come almost entirely from veggies or nuts on this diet.)

### Don't we need carbs for energy?

* Despite your body needing to break down carbs first and foremost when they are ingested, carbs are NOT an essential nutrient.  An essential nutrient is one your body needs to survive because it won’t be able to make it on its own.  But your body readily creates sugar from fat and protein to regulate blood sugar levels.

* Many people think they need carbs to perform at their very best performance-wise, but that’s not true either. It takes a few weeks, but after someone becomes completely adapted to the ketogenic diet, they become very, very efficient at burning fats for fuel and the bandwidth or throughput within which your body can do this at is great. It’s been ingrained in us that we need carbs to survive, or perform at our peak as athletes. We see sugar as energy. We see athletes drink Gatorade, so we think we can’t perform at our best without it. We almost rely on it as a crutch. But when you’re keto-adapted you are not chained to the hypoglycemic rollercoaster.

**I'm only a quarter way through the article and it's only summarized the key points but the rest of the article talks about** 

* What's wrong with carbs
* Which foods are high in carbs: all grains/bread, rice, pasta, cereal, starchy veggies, potato chips, vegetable chips, pita chips, cookies, crackers, ice cream, pudding, cakes, donuts, soft drinks (none of it!) and fruits/fruit juices (except berries and avocados).
* A rebuttal to people who say, "I like food too much."
* How to calculate how many NET carbs a food has (total carbs minus fiber)
* What to eat if you don't eat carbs?
* How sustainable is such a relatively restrictive diet? How do you eat out?
* Can you get all the proper nutrients off of it? How does one create a well formulated keto diet?
* Isn't this diet expensive?
* What are all the pros/cons of this diet?
* Progress pics 
 * **calories in/out only:** [eating at a simple deficit in 2013, I lost fat AND muscle](http://i.imgur.com/VRZuLsa.jpg)
 * **keto only:** [but on the keto diet, because it is muscle sparing, I lost fat AND retained muscle](http://i.imgur.com/FImPVTe.jpg)

* And please remember that diets are an extremely complex subject. There is no perfect diet and it's not all about just doing something for weight loss. Diet is influenced by culture, religion, social influence, family, ethics... for some it's as simply as drinking soylent and nothing more. For some, they view it through a lens of biochemistry and physiology and geek out over metabolically hacking their body. It's all about finding out what works for you. On the keto diet, I was able to sleep well and have good recovery between strength/skill training sessions and felt a constant state of mental focus (I still do, I've been keto for like 3 months straight now with 5 months total experience), so it's nice to be able to share what it's all about, in case it jives with anyone.
