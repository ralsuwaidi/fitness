26/M/5’10 - How Fitness Transformed me from an Obese, Narrow-Minded Gamer into a Wildly Different Person

**PHOTOS:**

[Before and After Photos](https://imgur.com/a/zhqy9Ux) (TLDR): 

**Weight:** 

215lbs —> 155 lbs

(That’s 97.5kg down to 70.3kg)



**Time Period:** 

Technically 3 years of weight loss (explained in post) but the most dramatic changes happened in the past year. I started lifting in May of 2017.



**Lift Progress Summary:**

DL:       95lbs -–> 295x3 (275x5)

Squat:  75lbs —> 265x5

Bench: 105lbs –> 185x3 (175x5)

OHP:    65lbs —> 115x5



Never did 1-rep Maxes. These are just the highest lifts I’ve recorded in the gym. 



Most of these are from a few months ago when I weighed a few more pounds and my lifting routine was more ‘consistent.’ My lifts are a bit lower now.



**Program:** 

For the most part, I based it on u/metallicadpa ’s PPL Program. It’s available in the ‘recommended routines’ in this subreddit’s wiki.

EDIT: A lot of folks in the comments asked for a link to the PPL program. Here it is:
https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/


*Disclaimer: I didn’t truly follow this program as prescribed. And to be honest, if I had stuck to this program more strictly, I’m sure I would’ve seen a lot better results. It’s very effective. But for a variety of life/personal reasons combined with some fuckarounditis, it wouldn’t be fair to the creator to say that I ‘actually’ followed his program for a full year. Nonetheless, I’m pretty happy with my progress so far and I owe a lot to this program for giving me my foundation.*



**Diet**

As for Diet, I just tracked my calories with MyFitnessPal. 



The specifics of what I ate are not too important - but the act of counting calories consistently is the single most important thing I did in this entire journey. 



Yes daily calorie-tracking is tedious. Yes it sucks. But that’s exactly why so many people fail at weight loss. If you want the results bad enough, you’ll do it.



*Anyway - A typical day of eating might look like this:* 

-I skip breakfast most days. I guess this means I “intermittent fast.” It works for me because I’m not hungry in the morning and I’m always very hungry after work / in the evening.



Lunch (~420 calories)

* Turkey sandwich on thin wheat
*
* Sliced orange/yellow bell peppers
 
* Dannon Light/Fit Greek Yogurt



I like to meal prep this on Sundays so it’s basically on auto-pilot.



Dinner: (1000-1100 calories)

* Chicken Breast - 8-12oz

* Small/healthy microwaveable meals, usually with Chicken (think weight watchers, healthy choice, etc)
 
* Steamed Vegetables
 
* A few cups of Greek Yogurt 



Also coffee and water. Copious amounts of black coffee and water.



**PREFACE:**

First, this is probably not the most dramatic transformation you’ll ever read. But this roughly marks 1 year of ‘getting my shit’ together so it seems like a fitting time for a progress post. So much has changed for me in the last year, between work, life, fitness, and more - and most of it started with discovering the r/fitness community a year ago. So it felt like the right time to post something.



Second, while this post is not about video games - some sections will talk about them in-detail. I’ll try to mark the sections as skippable for the non-gaming audience here. But I think there are a lot of folks, specifically gamers, who might be in a similar situation to the ‘old’ me. So I’m leaving those details in this story for folks who might be in a similar phase of their fitness journey to where I used to be.



Lastly, I’ll note that I don’t believe video games are inherently ‘bad’ (I still enjoy them a lot from time to time). It’s just that in my case, my old approach to games reinforced a very problematic and sedentary lifestyle. A lifestyle that I’m now happy to be rid of.



Alright, let’s begin - 



**Background / How I got fat**



I’ve actually been out of shape for most of my life.  I almost never exercised or thought at all about the consequences of what I was eating. I typically ate whatever was either convenient or tasted good without ever thinking about what I was putting into my body. 



Growing up, I never had any athletic sports that I was passionate about, but I definitely did have a ‘competitive drive.’ My main hobby growing up was playing video games - a hobby that i’ve loved since as long as I could remember holding a SNES controller in my hands. As I got older, this ‘drive’ manifested itself in my gaming experience. Starting with Halo, then Starcraft 2 (hey look at my reddit name), then eventually League of Legends and more - the drive kept me hooked on games. I was determined to get better. 



The positive side - is that I developed some helpful habits that helped me to get decently good at games. I had the discipline to constantly self-criticize my own play, refine my technique, and learn from gaming professionals in order to get better than my peers and improve.



But this ‘drive’ mindset was a double-edged sword. While the ‘focus’ was certainly valuable, I realize now that I was actually extremely narrow-minded. I ignored many other critical aspects of my life in favor of competitive improvement. It took me a long time to realize this. Snapping out of it - really all began here with r/fitness.



**College - The Weight-Gain Train**



When I went to college, everything got worse...waaaaaaay worse. My newfound ‘freedom’ led to increased consumption of junk food, much more heavy drinking. I basically realized I could eat Pizza and Chipotle whenever I wanted. So I did just that.



I was also a chronic procrastinator and had a very unhealthy approach to academics. It would not be uncommon to find me in a computer lab procrastinating until 2:30am, ordering a pizza, and then finally doing my assignment. Despite spending hours constantly procrastinating or gaming, I always told myself “I didn’t have the time to workout” because I was constantly behind on schoolwork. 



This led to a significant weight gain (I know, shocker!). But I got better at games - which was all I really cared about.



**Post-Graduation**



When I graduated I weighed about 215lbs. I gained more than 40 pounds while in my 4 years at school.



Now that I had graduated and had a full-time job, I ‘said’ enough is enough and tried to refine some of my bad habits. I cut out major diet offenders. No more late night pizza orders. No more soda or energy drinks. Yes I’d still frequently eat junk food for dinner and didn’t track my calories, but I forced myself to at least eat a healthier lunch.



And I began running. God this sucked at first. I remember I couldn’t run a single damn mile. Not even close. I was wheezing and drooping in sweat in less than a half-mile. But I just kept going to a local park after work and made running part of my routine.  Gradually the distance increased substantially.



All these new habits took me a long way. I lost quite a bit of weight (at least 20lbs). I was feeling good about it. Eventually even tried on my old suit and my crazy long sleeves made me feel like one of those inflatable ‘arm flailing’ tube men that you see in front of grand openings. Success (or so I thought).



But eventually the progress stopped. The weight loss halted. It happened because it got harder and I wasn’t actually pushing myself. I wasn’t really trying.



And I also still poured almost every free moment I had into video games...



**From Gaming to Fitness**



This section probably won’t make any sense to anyone who doesn’t play competitive video games so you can SKIP this section and jump to ‘EPIPHANY’ if that’s not your cup-of-tea.



But failing to get promoted into Diamond league in League of Legends might’ve been one the best things that ever happened to me. Let me attempt to explain.



I was not just a casual gamer. I always strived to be competitive. I always wanted to be the best (or at least constantly getting better). I was addicted to seeing myself improve. In order to make that happen, I developed a sense of discipline and practice that helped me to climb decently fast. I won’t pretend I was a League ‘God’ or anything. There are many better players than me. But I eventually climbed to top 2% in North America. I also co-launched and hosted a weekly podcast related to teaching people how to improve at the game (shoutout to anyone from Tforce/4wards who might be reading this) and I gave individual coaching/lessons. And that was all while working a full-time job with a 1.5hour commute, often playing half as many ranked games as many of my similarly-ranked peers.



Now I attribute my rapid climb to my discipline & focus combined with my ‘drive.’ No matter how high I climbed, I was a constant student of the game. I learned from watching Korean pro players who were way better than me. I’d spend hours breaking down what they did to be successful and trying to apply it to my own play. I constantly ‘drilled’ myself in somewhat repetitive tasks and game mechanics until it was almost sub-conscious to me. I regularly reviewed my play, or when I’d make mistakes and was very critical of myself because I wanted to get better. 



And I climbed because…I wanted it. I wanted it bad. I worked really hard at it. I was driven. But as anyone who has played the game knows - many folks don’t truly care about their rank until the season is about to end. Until there’s a deadline that they have to address. That was me (remember I mentioned I was a procrastinator?). 



At the very end of season 6 of league of legends, I decided to “push myself” to get into Diamond - but I had waited way too long to start. As the deadline approached, I dropped nearly everything else in my life to focus on climbing. I basically sat at my computer all day grinding games, practicing technique, or reviewing replays. Eat, sleep, game, repeat. I put in a ton of work and saw a tremendous amount of progress in a short period of time…



But...it didn’t happen. I ran out of time. The weekend before the season ended, I was a single victory away from winning a promotion series that would have granted me my coveted “diamond border” multiple times. But I didn’t make it. I was crushed.



Why do I mention this all this gaming nonsense? I swear it connects back to fitness. Here we go.



When I didn’t make it to Diamond, my first instinct was to get the climb out of the way early in Season 7. I was already practically there - so I thought “this will be a piece of cake.” With this mindset I became lazy. I cut a lot of corners that helped me to climb in the first place and eventually started falling in rank. I realized that if I wanted to see the type of progress I needed to climb quickly again - I was going to have to invest every ounce of my free time and energy into this game again… 



…And then that thought filled me with dread.



**EPIPHANY**

Wait. why? Why should I work so hard for this? 



Now knowing how grueling my experience would be to get back to another Diamond promotion series with my old approach to the game - I asked myself - how could I possibly justify it? I would have to give up every free moment of my life to get a shiny border on a loading screen for internet bragging rights. 



I decided that I’d be better off putting my time and efforts into something else. I hypothesized that if I put half as much effort into any other aspect of my life as I did trying to climb in video games - that I could see tremendous results. So I decided to test that theory…with fitness. 



I then quit playing ranked league altogether, took a “before” photo - and then read the r/fitness wiki.



**Foray into fitness - 1 Year Ago**

Many initial struggles. I was terrified of attempting compound lifting movements at they gym. But I also knew they were important. I watched a bunch of YouTube videos on proper form and read a bunch of articles on diet. Most importantly - I read through the r/fitness wiki. Multiple times.



I settled on doing u/metallicadpa’s PPL routine. And I started counting my calories strictly.



* A month later - wow. 

* 2 months and some beginner gains later - **Holy shit.** This actually works. 



I realized that if you truly work at something with persistence and  discipline day-in and day-out - then the seemingly impossible suddenly becomes possible. And I was never the same again.



**Transforming my Life**



With all this extra time I had saved from not grinding video games - it quickly became apparent that I should pick up some new hobbies and practices. 



I picked up rock climbing to stay active. I got back into playing guitar -which I hadn’t played in years. I pushed myself to be more social and outgoing after years of sitting inside a room playing games until 2am  nearly every evening. Soon my whole life felt very different. 



Over the course of the next year:

WORK - I got promoted, and also joined an awesome new team recently. They’re the best.



SOCIAL - I made new friends, re-kindled old friendships, and ‘hung out’ with people way more than when I was grinding games. I shifted from my narrow-minded self that was only concerned with video games, who struggled to relate to people —> to being genuinely interested in other people and their passions. It’s been a massive life-changer.



LIVING - I gradually transitioned from a recent college grad with student-loan debt living with his parents to an adult who is living debt-free in one of the most incredible cities in the world. 



PRODUCTIVITY, PROCRASTINATION, & STRESS - I realized that a lot of the stress I had and procrastination could be avoided by applying proper discipline and planning. By writing things down and properly managing my time with discipline day-in and day-out, I often work half as hard as I used to and achieve 5-10x times the results in terms of productivity. I often think back on how much stress I had during school with procrastination, and I now think I could easily get way better grades with half the amount of ‘effort.’  



TRAVEL - Last year I went on a two-week Euro-trip with my friends and it was one of the best experiences of my life. This [photo from Norway](https://imgur.com/a/mZD8ryD) has one of my best genuine smiles. I love doing active & outdoor activities now. I am planning to travel more in the coming months.



**A brief note regarding fitness, girls, and confidence:**

A lot of people get into fitness to attract the opposite sex (or same sex). It was certainly a ‘motivating factor’ for me initially.



And yes - the gains have helped :)



But really, the added confidence I gained from smiling at myself in the mirror in the morning, combined with developing a more broad range of hobbies & interests - did way more for my dating life than just fitness alone. If I just replaced my obsession with gaming with an obsession with fitness - I doubt I would be as happy as I am now.



**Looking forward**

I’ve never really “bulked” before. I’m eager to see where I could be after a full bulk-cut cycle. But right now, fitness has taken a bit of a back-seat compared to some other priorities in my life. That said, I’m looking to start my first true ‘bulk’ sometime in the late fall, most likely November. 



For now, I’ll continue my weekly ritual of eating at a deficit during the week so that I can enjoy the weekends without as much guilt and still say ‘somewhat’ lean. I’m probably not going to have a 6 pack at this rate (not willing to give up alcohol and other delicious weekend foods right now). Admittedly, that was a pretty hard pill to swallow initially but I’ve come to terms with it. That said, I lead a pretty active lifestyle and I don’t anticipate I’ll get too out of shape either. And then I’ll reign it all in and get ‘strict’ again once I start my bulk so it doesn’t get too out of control.



**Tips / advice that helped me**

-**Read the wiki.** I know that this is beaten to death here, but seriously do it. It’s probably the most important thing related to fitness that I’ve ever read.

-Consistency is everything. Fuck “motivation.” This is about consistently about getting your ass in the gym and watching your diet. Even on days when you really don’t want to.

-Once you lose some weight - remember to buy new clothes that fit you. Seriously makes a big difference.

-Meal prep on Sundays. Eat copious amounts of Chicken & Greek Yogurt. Drink plenty of Black Coffee.



**Special Thanks**

-This community. Especially progress posters. You gave me the reinforcement I needed. Thank you.

-Thanks to u/metallicadpa for writing the PPL program.

-And special thanks to the mods who keep this place up and running



**Lastly I’ll just say this:**

If you decide you want it bad enough, that’s literally all it takes. Fitness is not complicated.



There’s no magical barrier from preventing you from succeeding. Ignore any dumb voice or excuse in your head. It’s all bullshit. 



Seriously, your results are yours, and they are there for the taking. Just start.
