I get the camaraderie of working out with friends: good conversations, the ability to push each other, and an automatic spot. But I just love lifting alone. It's basically the only time of the day where I can have some ME time, whether it's just to get some anger out on the weights, or just enjoying a good podcast while working out.

Anyone else feel the same?
