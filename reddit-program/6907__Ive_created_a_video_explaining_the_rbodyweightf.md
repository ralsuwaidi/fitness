* People often come to /r/bodyweightfitness looking for a good routine to do train at home, or at the local park, without the need to go to a gym and we often refer them to the ["Recommended Routine."](https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine) This is a free, full-body, strength training routine which has helped countless people build muscle, lose fat and gain new physical abilities.

* We know that it can be overwhelming to read it all, especially if one is new to working out. So to help make it easier, I've created this video that explains the overall structure of the routine, including how the progressions work and all the little details so that you could understand everything in just a few minutes!

* Hopefully this helps make it easier for everybody to feel more comfortable to simply jump in and start working out with confidence! I hope you like it!
