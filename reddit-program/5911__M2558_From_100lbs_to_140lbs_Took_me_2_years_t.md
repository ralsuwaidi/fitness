Before & After: http://imgur.com/Ffs8inq

A little backstory.
It all started a few years ago when I went to the bowling alley with a group of friends and I was unable to curl the 8lb ball. Pretty big eye opener that made me want to hit the gym. I thought at first it would be nearly impossible, but my buddies gave me a hand and were my gym partners from that day on. My goal weight is 155 pounds and hopefully someday I'll reach that goal. Regardless I am pretty content with this transformation.

**Edit 1**: I see that I must provide more information to how I achieved this transformation. I will provide one soon. 

**Edit 2**: Sorry work got a little busy, anyways. 

First and foremost I ordered this [weight gainer](http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/opt/whey.html) to help me gain some mass. To my embarrassment, yes the picture on the left was weighing at approximately 100 lbs. That was during the time I just ate once or twice a day. I changed that eating lifestyle to eating at least 4 time a day with two protein shakes, one in the morning and one before bed. I also took some preworkout (Jack3d, C4) to give me that boost of energy necessary to rep some weights.

As far as for workouts and reps, my buddies were my trainers. So I will try my best as to what exactly they made me do each day. I found this on my notes on my phone.

**Edit 3**: For some reason I can't see all the comments after the first 200 that initially posted, sorry if I haven't responded. You can PM if you want until I figure out what's going on with not being able to see all 500+ comments.

**Edit 4**: oh wow it has been overwhelming, thank you everyone for the compliments and the funny comments. Think this is the best cake day ever, first time ever gilded as well. I still am unable to see any of the new comments even when I select the new comments section. I feel bad not being able to read all 700+ comments of yours. Hopefully this gets resolved, it has never happened before.

**Let me know if there is any mistake or any misunderstanding, I'll try my best to clarify anything.**
