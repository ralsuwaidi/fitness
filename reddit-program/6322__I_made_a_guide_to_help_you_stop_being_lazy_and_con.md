Here’s the guide: [Don't Just Do It – A 5 Step Technique to Consistently Get in the Gym](http://routineexcellence.com/dont-just-do-it-a-5-step-technique-to-consistently-get-in-the-gym/)

Hey everyone,

The title pretty much says it. For a long time, consistency was the biggest problem I had with my workouts. I struggled because I would go all out for a couple of weeks, then get tired, quit, and have the same body I’d always had. 

When I started studying psychology, both in college and on my own time, I realized that I could use what I was learning to help me work out more consistently. Since then, I’ve gained 40 pounds of lean muscle. Of course I eventually learned a lot more about training, but it all started with that consistency. 

I wanted to write this guide to help anyone who’s struggling to make exercise a habit. It might also help people who have trouble getting their gym buddies to pony up and tag along. 

The guide is split into two parts:

* Part one covers the basic psychological tactics that you can use to make exercise a part of your daily routine – without relying on willpower
* Part two puts those tactics together into a concrete plan. In 5 steps, you’ll come away knowing exactly how you can achieve your goals.

Part one tactics include chaining (connecting your workouts to other events that you know will happen), precommitments (planning to work out well ahead of when you actually go to the gym), rewards (how to use small, consistent rewards instead of large ones), and barrier reduction (how to get rid of what stops you from working out). 

Here's [a quick overview infographic](http://imgur.com/E5pPmva) of the 5 steps in part 2. 

* In step one, you'll set a specific, actionable goal that lends itself to a clear and specific path of action. 
* In step two you'll set subgoals, along with times to check in on your progress towards your ultimate destination
* In step 3 you'll identify the specific problems that might stop you from achieving your ultimate goal
* In step 4 you'll plan ahead, figuring out ways to address your specific roadblocks
* Step 5 puts it all together. You'll come away with one piece of paper, your roadmap, that details exactly how you'll reach your destination    

I hope you find this helpful! 

Psychology has had a huge impact on my life, and I’m happy to answer as many questions as I know the answers to.
