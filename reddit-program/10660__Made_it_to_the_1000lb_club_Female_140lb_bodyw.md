Yesterday I hit a 455lb / 207kg deadlift, which brought my total up to 1,002lb. I am super psyched! When I started out I couldn't even imagine this was even possible. Bodyweight between 137 and 140lb (~63kg).

**Past Training**


I've been lifting off and on since the summer of 2011, so about 6.5 years. I started powerlifting training specifically in the fall of 2013, my 1st powerlifting meet was summer 2014 after reddit told me I was actually pretty good and should compete, lol. I was 110lb / 50kg when I started lifting.

I was self coached up until this past summer when I started working with RTS and Mike. 

I did starting strength my 1st year of powerlifting but stalled out around the time I did my 1st meet. My numbers were S:245 B:135 D:335 @120lb bodyweight. After that, I switched to a PPL x2 that I wrote. I did that for another year and a half till my lifts were around S: 275 B:150 D:405. I then started an upper/lower split where I did bench 2x a week and squat + deadlifts 2x a week but I alternated which I focused on as the main lift. I was on that until I started coaching with RTS. My lifts were S:315 B:175 D:425 and bodyweight was 128 out of comp.


**Current Training**


I decided to go up a weight class at that time, from 125 (57kg) to 138 (63kg). I am 5'5 so I was doing myself a huge disservice competing in the 57kg class where everyone else was a half foot smaller than me. Since going up 4 months ago, my lifts have increased dramatically and so has my wilks! RTS had me on an upper/lower split similar to my old one till I competed at USAPL Raw Nationals last month. 

Since Nationals, I have been on a full body routine 4x a week, with a bench variation each workout as well as a squat or deadlift variation and accessories. The volume each workout is low to make up for the high frequency. It took my joints and muscles about 3 weeks to get used to the frequency. I seem to be handling it ok now.

The deadlift PR was a total YOLO move on my part and not programmed at all :). I wanted to play with the deadlift bar. This was my 2nd time ever using one, with the 1st being back in 2014.

**Diet**

Pretty relaxed. I suck at eating so my #1 goal is just getting my calories. I maintain around 2200-2500. My #2 goal is getting enough protein. I aim for 100g bare minimum and 160g+ when I am prepping for a comp. For supplements, I use protein powder and sometimes take creatine. I take a multivitamin, fish oil, vitamin D, zinc, magnesium, and melatonin every night before bed.
