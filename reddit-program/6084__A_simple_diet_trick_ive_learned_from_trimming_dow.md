So its nothing revolutionary but its the way you eat. For starters I will drink 2 glasses of water before taking a bite. Then you will eat your veggies first. Im talking a lot of veggies I ussually will eat a whole steam bag to myself, then move on to your proteins, then your starches. 

This is for the people who cannot portion out their foods. I would overeat and not see any progress. By doing this you are filling space in your stomach with low calories first then your proteins and by this time you are getting full and will eat less starches. 

Take it or leave but it has worked for me and thought it may help some of you. Thanks for the read.
