Hi Reddit!
-
I'm posting to show my continued progress and provide information to allow others to do what I have done. Reading transformation posts on r/fitness is what got me started on my journey and I hope my own transformation post can inspire others to do the same. I owe a debt of gratitude to this community and would like to pay it back by helping others achieve what I have achieved. I will answer any question you may have. So ask!

**Recap**
---------------------
---------------------

-
 
* Back in 2011 I was diagnosed as prediabetic and **[clinically obese](http://i.imgur.com/WEZ1S8U.png)**.

* I wanted to lose weight so I started lifting weights and tracking macros.

* I lost 80lbs and was left with **[loose skin](http://i.imgur.com/mIFxjAB.png)** and got it **[surgically removed](http://i.imgur.com/XLGMNYs.jpg)**.

* After the skin was gone, I decided I could finally get over my fear of taking my shirt off in public, so I entered a **[bodybuilding competition](http://i.imgur.com/5qPbxJR.jpg)**.

-

**Update**

* **The bulk** - After the competition, I decided I wanted to add size and get stronger, so I started eating in a way that would increase my bodyweight and in turn also increase my strength and size. This is called **bulking**. 

* **[The first bulk got out of hand](http://i.imgur.com/0I3iD1X.png)**. Although my strength had incresed a lot, when I cut down I realized that **[I hadn't gained much size](http://i.imgur.com/9qWVcCe.png)**. 

* **Controlled surplus** - I learned that the amount of muscle I grew during a bulk was not necessarily proportionate to the amount of weight I was gaining. Our bodies can only create a small amount of muscle at a time, so there is no benefit to being in a large surplus of calories versus a smaller surplus of calories. The only difference is the amount of fat that is stored in addition to the muscle in a larger surplus. The important thing is to be in a surplus. This means taking in more calories than you expend in order to allow your body to adapt and get bigger and stronger.

* **Current condition** - I have since been bulking and cutting for a couple years. I have found a groove where I relax my diet during the winter months and eat how I want while tracking my macros to make sure I am getting sufficient protein. As a naturally fat person, this results in weight gain. I then cut during the spring or summer months. Here is my most recent **[winter bulk (8 months) and summer cut (10 weeks)](http://i.imgur.com/c2Cf5tk.jpg)**

**Diet**
---------------------
---------------------

-

* As a formerly obese person, I have tried or been prescribed just about every diet out there. What I have found to be most effective is the idea of energy balance. If your goal is to gain weight, you must eat more than your body requires. This is a caloric surplus. If you want to lose weight, you need to eat less than your body requires. This is a caloric deficit. If you want to maintain your bodyweight, you must eat around the amount your body expends in a day. This is called maintenance.

-

* **Maintenance** - In order to diet (gaining or losing) you must first find your maintenance calories. You can use a calorie calculator like **[this one](http://mytdee.com/)** to help estimate this number but this is only an estimate and you will need to use trial and error to find your own personal maintenance.

-


* **Tracking weight** - How I find my maintenance calorie intake is by weighing myself daily and taking my weekly averages. If my average weight from 2 consecutive weeks is around the same, I have found my maintenance calories. It is a moving target and will not be the same at the end of a cut as it was at the beginning of a cut.

-

* **Tracking calories** - Once I know my maintenance calories, I can gain weight by adding calories to that number or lose weight by subtracting. When I begin a gaining or losing phase, I always start with increments of 500 calories at a time added onto my daily calorie goals. If I was maintaining my weight on 2500 calories a day, I would begin my diet on 2,000. I subtract these calories from carbs and fats. The tricky part is tracking accurately. I use **[MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com)**.

-

* **Macros -** In a caloric surplus, as long as I am getting enough protein (0.8 to 1 gram per lb of bodyweight), it does not matter where the rest of the calories come from. In a deficit on the other hand, it can be important. If I am dieting, I always make sure to have at least 50 to 60 grams of fat. I have gone below 50 and I felt horrible. I keep my protein static year round and I eat as many carbs as my goals will allow. I like food.

-

* **[bulking macros](http://i.imgur.com/U7c5YXG.jpg)**: 450 carb/190 protein/75 fat
* **[cutting macros](http://i.imgur.com/pADfU13.jpg)**: 250 carb/190 protein/60 fat

* **Supplements:** creatine, fish oil, multivitamin, whey. I have never used steroids.

**Training**
---------------------
---------------------

-

* **Strength training** To increase size and strength it is necessary to practice progressive overload. This is the idea of handling a higher workload overtime. The easiest way to do this is by focusing on strength. For this reason, I suggest starting out with a strength routine. I have done a couple strength routines in the past including **[5/3/1](https://jimwendler.com/blogs/jimwendler-com/101065094-5-3-1-for-a-beginner)** and **[Starting Strength](http://startingstrength.com/get-started/programs)**. These are great routines.

-

* **Bodybuilding** - Over my lifting career, I have gravitated towards bodybuilder style lifting. I lift relatively heavy weights with an emphasis on stretching the muscle at one end of the rep and squeezing the muscle at the other end. I find that I feel good doing this and do not get injured. Most importantly, I enjoy it. By doing this day in and day out, I do gain strength (progressive overload) although not nearly as quickly as I would with a strength routine.

**But how??**
---------------------
---------------------

-

* **"How do I motivate myself?"** This is the most frequent question I've received from my reddit posts and it’s difficult to answer. I don't know what motivates anyone else. For me, I got sick and tired of being sick and tired. I read every transformation post on r/fitness over and over again until I had an idea of what to do and I finally took action. After that, I fell in love with this lifestyle. I no longer need to stay motivated because this is just what I like to do.

-

* **Make it routine** - When I was obese, I worked 40 hours a week and was very tired when I got home. The last thing I wanted to do was drive another 20 minutes to the gym. What I did instead was brought my gym clothes with me to work. I changed in the bathroom at work and stopped at the gym on my way home. This way it wasn't a choice. I did not need strong willpower every day. It was just part of my routine. The hardest part is often just getting to the gym.

**Lessons learned**
---------------------

---------------------

-

* **Cardio is not necessary for weightloss** - In the begining of my journey, **[I ran on an elliptical every day and I hated it](http://i.imgur.com/NJWhPjM.jpg)**. What I didn't know at the time was the idea of energy balance. Cardio worked because it increased my daily energy expenditure and forced me into a deficit. What I wish I had known was that those 300 calories I was burning every day on the elliptical could have just as easily come out of my diet. One less pop tart would have had the exact same affect on my physique. 

-

* **Tracking accurately** - Diet is the most important aspect of fitness. The way we look, feel and perform comes down to diet above all else. In order to control this aspect, it is important to be able to track it accurately. For me, this took a lot of practice. A behavior of mine that contributed to my obesity and still hinders my diet sometimes is unconscious eating. I stand in front of the fridge or a cupboard and shovel food into my mouth without even recognizing it. By tracking everything that enters my mouth I am able to recognize unconscious eating and stop myself before I start. Tracking my diet, body weight, pictures and the weights I lift also gives me the ability to view progress and analyze variables. Being able to manipulate these variables is essential to achieving my goals.

If you are thinking about getting started on your own fitness journey, do yourself a favor and begin today. My only regret is not starting sooner. I have found a new way of life in fitness and it has allowed me to achieve things I didn't think were possible for me. Thanks again for all the support. I am truly grateful for this subreddit.

Ask any questions you may have. I will do my best to answer every last one.
