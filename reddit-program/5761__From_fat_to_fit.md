Hey all of you.
TL;DR Was fat, am not anymore.

Just wanted to talk to you a bit about my transformation in the last 2 years. It was a hell of a rollercoaster.

In May 2015, I had enough. I was feeling sick, I was 24 and supposed to be in my prime. But at 340 pounds and 5’11’’, it was not the case.
So I decided to change. I went on the subreddit r/loseit and learned how to lose weight by counting your calories.
And it worked.

In the first week I lost 17 pounds. Sure, a lot of it was water but God did it give me motivation to continue. The second week, I was 10 pounds lighter. It really worked. 

So I counted my calories until I was around 215 pounds. By then, I had lost 125 pounds in around 7 months.

While I was doing this, I decided to do the C25K (r/C25K) to help me start running. I ran my first 5K while I was weighing 275 pounds. It was slow, so very slow, but I did it. I was SO proud of myself. I was working on becoming a healthier person.
That’s when I saw one of my childhood friend who is a gym rat. He was so proud of me and asked me if I was going to the gym. I was, but I did not follow any program. I was still doing some “FuckArountIt”, meaning I didn’t know what I was doing. So he helped me to do a basic program.

With this new program in the gym, I then started to follow something like LeanGains (r/leangains) in counting my macros.
Training days 1800 Calories High Protein, High Carbs, Low Fat.
Rest Day 1500 Calories High Protein, Low Carbs High Fat.


And I continued to shed some fat. It was slower, of course but progress kept on going. I stopped after 11 months at 172 pounds lost. I was weighing 168 pounds and was pretty skinny.

At this point, I started going to maintenance a bit, around 2200/2400 calories. It was summer so I went in vacation, had fun and enjoyed my new shape. I even did a 21k for fun with a friend.


So, here we are. 168 pounds, able to run 21k, going to the gym 3 to 4 time a week. Eating 2200 calories a day. What was I going to do now?


It’s Bulk time. To do this, I changed my 3 day Split PPL a bit.

So in March, I started a cut to shed a bit of the fat that I got while doing this lean bulk. I finished it in June at around 175lbs. I was doing the same program. Just added some cardio 3 days (10k).
As for the macros: 
Training Days 2100 Calories, High Protein, High Carbs, Low Fat
Rest Days 1700 Calories, High Protein, Low Carbs, High Fat

Since then, I’ve switched to nsuns 5days program and upped my calories to go into maintenance/recomp. I’m still getting leaner so I guess everything is going great.
