**EDIT:** Since people have been asking me about my daily schedule, I've added a template to the Google Drive titled **"SCHEDULE TEMPLATE"**. Also, I like to make playlists, so check this shit out if you want some gym jams https://open.spotify.com/user/12153177872?si=SeDqjF2WRNic5q4CDRsGIA

Starting: 18 yo 5'5" Male, 121lbs, 19% bf

Today: 20 yo 5'5" Male, 131 lbs, 11% bf

I got rejected by a very cute girl on March 10, 2016. Later that night, as I lay on my bed covered in a greasy sauce from the pound of Buffalo Chicken Cheese Fries I had just devoured, I took one last sip of my Green Tea Arizona and decided it was time for a change. I climbed down from my bunk bed and had my roommate take pictures of my sulking ass. The rest is history. 
When I posted that progress picture to instagram, I got a flood of questions from my friends asking how they can do the same. Instead of answering the same question 100 times, I made a google drive folder with all the info they'd ever need: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Y8MmU9NVxdFgeKU5cB-oM8TVUgnESCh4

**PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE MY POST FOR LACK OF INFORMATION, THE DRIVE HAS IT ALL**

This includes my **diet plan, my routines**, and a quick rundown of my 2 year journey and what I learned about bodybuilding. Take note, I'm a very straightforward, no bs type of guy, so what I wrote in that 13 page manuscript is a hard, honest opinion on what I believe is necessary to seriously pursue bodybuilding. If you want to know how to truly start bodybuilding without wasting time sifting through Bro-Science, it's all in my "How To Get Swole" document. I also have a potty mouth, but that's something you're gonna have to deal with.

With that being said: I was 18 years old and started at 121 lbs, 19% body fat. I only gained about 20lbs of lean body mass, which goes to show how much of a trial-and-error process this has been. I was in a weird grey area of body composition, being skinny fat. I was weak and fat, so I didn't know whether to bulk or cut first. I tried cutting first and that was a huge mistake. I then decided to bulk and focus on strength gains, and everything took off from there. 

I started with Strong Lifts, going from benching the bar for 5x5 to benching a plate for 5x5. I did this for about a year until I could squat and deadlift 2 plates for 5x5. 

My second year of training, I started incorporating accessory lifts. I made a Push Pull Leg style routine, putting shoulders on my leg day due to excessive fatigue on my push days. I did 2 days on one day off. I made the mistake of dirty bulking my first year, so I decided to start cutting. I counted calories and macros, and got to about 13% body fat before I gave up and blew right back up to 16%. I finally decided to start a serious cut, getting down to about 11% which took 5 months of strict dieting. 

Now that I'm as lean as I've ever been, I plan on starting my very first lean bulk in preparation for my first bodybuilding competition. I have about a year and a half to train, so I plan to bulk until January 3rd, allowing myself about 16 weeks to cut before my show. I'm going to focus entirely on hypertrophy training. The routine is in the drive folder I posted earlier.
