I know my lifts are nothing compared to most peoples, but I'm happy with how far I've come so far.


I have been extremely skinny my whole life and Just about 1 year ago from today, I decided I was sick of how skinny and weak I was, I was basically an anorexic weight. I got my friend to show me how to do everything in the gym until I knew enough to go on my own. I know what I've done is nothing exceptionally impressive and I still have a ton of weight to put on, but I'm happy with how it's going so far. I started off with just 3 full body workouts a week and am now on PPL 6 day program, but using a form of 531 for my main lifts.

**Routine:**

I go to the gym usually 5 days a week running a 6-day PPL program but I just continue on the next week starting from the 6th day. 

**DAY1: Push A**

-Bench press 5 - 3 - 1 style, so reps change every week.

-Overhead press 5 - 3 - 1.

-Incline dumbbell press 3x8-12

-Seated lateral raise 4x12-15

-Weighted dips - 4x8

-OH Tricep extension 3x8-12


**DAY2: Pull**

-Deadlifts 5-3-1

-Weighted Pullups 3x5

-Dumbell rows 3x8-12

-Facepulls 3x12-15

-EZ Bar curls 3x8-12

-DB Rear Delt Flies 3x12-15

-Hammer curls 3x8-12


**DAY3: Legs**

-Squats 5-3-1

-Front squat 4x8

-Hip thrusts 4x8

-Leg Curl 4x8-12

-Calf raises 4-12-15

-Lunges 4x 8-12

The rest of the days are Push, Pull and legs again with some variation, doing lighter lifts and more reps for the main lifts. Don't want to make the post too long. I also do a decent amount of calisthenics training on the side with a long-term goal of full planche which I'm training for.

**Supplements**

I only use creatine nowadays, will start taking protein shakes when I have some more spare money

**Diet**

My diet is definitely one of the things that I need to improve on, I tracked my calories at the start but haven't in a while, until the other week where I have started again. For me, it's really hard to gain weight without tracking my calories properly.


**Ending words**
I still want to gain a lot more weight until I am fully comfortable with how my body looks, I want to be around 160 lbs, I just want to stay lean.
