For my diet plan I consumed at least 2k calories a day or more and my diet isn't really that fancy, I stay away from fried foods, noodles, rice, and really fattening foods on the week days and i definitely stay away from junk food/fast foods and soda and I usually eat grilled meats like chicken beef, etc I also eat salads, grilled vegetables and sometimes fish and I have little cheat days on the weekends where I eat meals that includes grilled meats on top of rice and Sundays are my full cheat days where I'll eat whatever I want and not go to hard of course!


This has really been a spiritual journey for me, because I have been over weight my whole entire life. I got laughed at, made fun of, and got joked about and it never felt good, then years passed by when i got my first job and they hosted a weight loss competition and I was like you know what lets try it and finally had the courage to sign up for a gym membership. At first it was going good and lost 60 lbs and felt impressed with my self, the results came in and i lost and felt devastated and lost motivation. My friends still encourage me and said "you know even though you lost you still lost 60 lbs which is incredible you should still keep trying!" and I was like "you know what? you guys are right!" So I tried going back, but it felt different, I didn't feel the same motivation as I did before and I didn't last long and kept on failing over and over and started to slowly gain my weight back and was depressed and went MIA. because I felt so ashamed. Years passed by and I moved to Saint Louis to work at my cousins restaurant to start my life anew, to find myself and then one night...I skyped with one of my best friends and when I saw him I was so shocked, because he been trying to get fit too and he looked amazing, he progressed so much and I was like wow....and we talked and he gave me good advice encouraging me and etc. All night I was thinking "wow....I'm really jealous, think i could've looked like that? what if I never gave up, what if I actually stayed on tracked..I don't think I can do it.." but the next morning something happened..I felt something different inside me and I was like you know what....I don't wanna feel this way anymore! No more What ifs! I'm going to get my ass up and go back to the gym! The first week there....I finally felt it...the motivation that I had before except this time it was stronger, this time I'm not going to give up, I won't fail this time, I'm going to turn those dreams into reality and I felt an endless amount of motivation flowing inside of me and was able to push my self beyond my limits and even surpassed my weight goal of 200 and got to 190 and i feel great!

I made a facebook video telling my whole story here, because I want to encourage people to never give up and achieve their goals!

No matter how many times you fall, always find the courage to stand back up again and keep pushing forward! I know I still got ways to go, but I promise I won't stop here and will keep on going strong because I do have some loose skin that I need to convert to muscle now and I won't give up! *Never Give up, Believe in yourself!*

*sorry for any grammar mistakes above* and I will take any tips available to help me lose some of the loose skin and I know I won't be able to completely get rid of it all, this is what i currently look like now
