And can we all agree to **NOT** be that person that complains non-stop about the "extra crowded gym"?

You see it every year. The gymbros and brolitas on your timelines start to moan and groan about all the new people at the gym.

They mock people for the "stupid" things they are doing/wearing/weighing/lifting. They "give them 2 weeks before they are gone". They state it and wear it as a badge of honor - "I go to the gym year round and this is my chance to remind everyone!"

Don't be that person. And if you see someone doing that shit, call them out on it.

Be the person that welcomes these new people to the gym. Offer a spot - or better yet, ask them for a spot. Use it as an opportunity to show them the ropes without the usual "You're doing that wrong, let me show you." Nobody likes that shit, especially people who are new and already feeling self-conscious. 

Lifting, training, building a healthier body - *it's something we should encourage.* Instead of mocking and taking bets on how long they will last, give them support to help them achieve their goals.
