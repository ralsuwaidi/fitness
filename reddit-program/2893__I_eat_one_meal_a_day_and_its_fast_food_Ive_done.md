So I’m a 20 year old guy who lives alone. I’m lazy and I’m terrible at cooking. I don’t know how to start a healthy diet and maintain it. I eat fast food everyday... once a day. Ive done this since last april. I feel pretty dead on the inside. I get agitated a lot. I have constant headaches. I don’t gain or lose weight. 

I feel like I either have or am going to have a major disease soon if I keep doing this. 

I’m at a normal weight but I am far from healthy. 

Can someone help me / give me any advice?



Edit: Thank you all for the insanely helpful feedback. I am trying to read each comment (I did not expect this much feedback). The key element I’ve been taking from this thread is to take baby steps. I also need to stop making excuses and just start trying.
